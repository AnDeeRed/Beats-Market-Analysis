RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2277,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.16530880230880232,0.5307694003527337,Neutral
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,562,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.17547510822510823,0.5111769480519481,Neutral
R2D114QWXW4IOU,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars I think they’re great,Maizy,5,"I like the sound a lot. I read a previous review from someone saying that the audio sounds really quiet at first and to fix it go into the setting for your headphones and change the press and hold feature to change the volume, after you use the headphones to turn the volume up, you can switch that setting off back to noise control. After i did that the audio was great, nice and loud. The buds fit nice for me with the small ear tips, not uncomfortable. The case is pretty light as well which i personally like a lot. Pretty solid headphones, I quite like them. The noise cancellation doesn’t entirely work, but i dont really mind too much since it still blocks out some noise just not entirely.Solid headphones, worth it :)","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AFRVRGYJJSBAELQK6XVCXXBCJXLA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.23106060606060605,0.5367424242424241,Positive
R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.15609410430839002,0.45681311413454295,Neutral
RRC5SI8P44LH4,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent -- Budget Friendly -- Good Review from a Beats Fan Girl and Audiophile,Mary Trotta,5,"Been a few months (May 2024) since the purchase so I wanted to give a nice, solid review.Battery life --- Excellent. 5 starsRange From Phone/Case --- Excellent. 5 starsStability --- Excellent. 5 starsCharging --- Excellent. 5 starsSound Quality --- Excellent. 5 stars (especially if you aren't an audiophile.

Wasn't expecting it to be that different. But, alas, it is. Now with that said, these here are super affordable. If you're on a budget get them. The fits, not on sale and on sale, not for a budget audio buyer. So think about what is important as far as staying in your ears.

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,65,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.12759740259740257,0.448728354978355,Neutral
R3MCOYFNYISC7D,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Bought for fiance and she loves them.,alex,5,Fiance loves them. She isn't very techy but she really likes the sound quality of these. I'm no audiophile but they sound great for the price I paid. They are comfortable and light. They look great but the case is big. The mic isn't too good but works when needed. The color is really what I got them for. She loves pink. She has really small ears and the headphone ear plugs that came with these were all too big. We swapped them out a few months later and haven't heard anything about it yet from her. So I'm assuming they are working great. She dropped one into the sink and they were soaked and stopped working for a few days I riced them and blowdried them and they came back to life. Still sound as good as ever. Wasn't expecting that from these. 5 stars fr. Nice job Apple.

R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,1,1697,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.14655797101449272,0.4858264320220842,Neutral
R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and it’s there for both buds plus case.They’re not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. They’re more noise reducing, so if that’s your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again it’s just enough to say it’s there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than what’s pictured.They’re extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it. I can honestly forget them in my pockets from how light they are.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AHPNYX3N7YSFKEGN2VREBPXEGT7A,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.146577380952381,0.5847619047619049,Neutral
R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn’t even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it’s quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I’m considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can’t fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product’s popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. I’ll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.1696582710219074,0.5025213170667715,Neutral

These headphones are, in fact, a cut above their competitors at cheaper levels. These things connect seamlessly with my Galaxy s23, and are pretty much rolling by the time you slide them in your ear.

R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AE4SCIH4EIJQNY4BA7TKFA7WD6IQ,1,1,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.17153209109730852,0.5116977225672878,Neutral

Although it had a charging cable, the length is very short. The sound quality is okay. The box included additional tip sizes for your ears. They are comfortable. These Beats Studio Buds were available at another retailer, but not in this red color. I was excited to be able to purchase this red for the same price here at Amazon. Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller. The small size of the case allows it to fit inside my jacket pocket, purse pocket, and pencil pouch.

The right ear bud produced no sound, so followed the trouble shooting instructions to delete from iPhone, then it would not re-sync. Called the support line, which was Apple support, and nice gentleman walked me through three attempts to re-set, then assured me that since it was under warranty that the problem would be taken care of. I was sent a pre-paid Fed Ex box with instructions to return. Three days later I received the renewed ear buds, which are now working just fine.I would recommend purchasing used ear buds at the reduced price since Apple will honor warranty and repair or replace, which Amazon will not do, but will only refund purchase price.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AE6RUVMPIW6ABPCRMHW6R5P2EUMQ,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.1647077922077922,0.509025974025974,Neutral

RZSTHLOHCJIJV,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.,bigyuki555,4,"Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.I switched from AirPod Pro1 after nearly 5 years of daily use believing that the Beats are new and normally only about $75 less than the AirPod Pro so the quality should be pretty similar between 5-year-old AirPods and brand-new Beats, and according to the text descriptions they are...but there is a remarkable difference in performance on the transparency mode.To the point where just having the earbuds in your ears and nothing playing is not any better than just having old style earbuds/earplugs in your ears. Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb. If you are most interested in audio quality and noise cancellation, then the Beats will tick your boxes.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHPF7TUW7QLABIRVWV55ORHEXFXA,1,1,Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.2802436125965538,0.532947118241236,Positive
R31F3JV1FZHHWR,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Prefect,Casey Alcorn,5,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds, and I am thoroughly impressed with their performance and features. These true wireless earbuds offer a fantastic combination of quality sound, active noise cancellation, and versatility across both Apple and Android devices.Firstly, the sound quality is outstanding. The Studio Buds deliver rich, balanced audio with deep bass and clear highs, making them perfect for music, podcasts, and calls. The active noise cancellation feature effectively reduces ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience wherever you are.The earbuds are lightweight and comfortable, designed for extended wear. They come with multiple ear tip options to ensure a secure fit, enhancing noise isolation and comfort even during vigorous activities.I appreciate the IPX4 rating, which makes the earbuds sweat and water-resistant. This feature is ideal for workouts or outdoor use, providing peace of mind against moisture damage.The built-in microphone offers clear voice quality during calls, ensuring excellent communication without background noise interference.Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, thanks to the Class 1 technology, providing a stable connection and extended range for reliable performance.Overall, the Beats Studio Buds are a top-notch choice for anyone seeking high-quality true wireless earbuds with noise cancellation, sweat resistance, and broad compatibility. They combine superior sound with comfort and durability, making them a valuable investment for both music enthusiasts and professionals alike.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AHM7ESHVZOTYFVQJFKL6LYJSCKKA,1,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.3606944444444444,0.5751388888888889,Positive

I did have to switch the size of silicone part on my earbuds to a smaller size that didn’t come with my set but after that I didn’t have any problems with them falling out.

When I first got them they would last all day without needing a charge but now I can barely get to lunch before needing to charge. That’s the only disappointing part is that battery life doesn’t last long over time of ownership. Great for listening to music all day long. I can’t hear when people come up to my desk.

R2FK2L6QM1M5F,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Loved ❤️; but wish a bit more ❤️‍🩹,Mr & Mrs,4,"Loved the ear buds. I use it mostly to listen to music and podcasts while I work on chores. Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on 😆.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.20966141001855287,0.4455266955266955,Positive
R7PJZSG0CG4IT,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Happy with these once I got a newer iPhone,Kindle Customer,5,"If I had paid full price for these I would have been more disappointed than I am. The sound quality is very good. I have an iPhone which is supposed to be ideal to use with these Beats but I have ongoing connectivity issues. I have some really cheap ear buds that as soon as I pick up the ear bud, it connects to my phone. These take longer and sometimes simply don’t connect at all. Then I have to put them back in their case and try again. I’m not sure if it is because my iPhone is an older model, but that shouldn’t matter as far as I know. For an Apple product, their quality falls short. I wouldn’t recommend these. I have had better experiences with Taotronics brand. These Beats were on sale and I thought I’d treat myself to something more upscale. I won’t do that again.UPDATE: I recently got a newer iPhone and wanted to edit my original review. Since I got the newer phone, I have had NO issues with the earbuds connecting to my phone. They connect seamlessly just as I hoped they would.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AFWQT73EO2KJQIYM7TLI7VWQXCSA,1,0,Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.2334259259259259,0.53663139329806,Positive

With my bose in ear headphones they had bass and almost enough volume. I went with these because my bose did not have the battery longevity that I needed. Also the beats don't feel secure in the ear. The bose are heavier but are definitely secure. The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around. I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast. I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good. Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set. Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks.

RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,1,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.29586805555555556,0.5570833333333334,Positive
RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,1,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.16554951690821254,0.43384230503795723,Neutral

R2J7QWXMNJ99A7,B096SV8SJG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Slippery design, battery and other issues!",Amazon Customer,3,"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGNI36H7MMREKIH6HPQHV2CGG7BA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,-0.015833333333333338,0.5750476190476191,Neutral

I do like the sounds quality and that my music sounds very clear. They are noise canceling and the battery life is also good. I can wear these all day at work with no issues of them dying. Down side to these are the transparency and noise canceling features suck. The features aren’t really necessary since the headphones themselves block out noise very well. You’ll hear just a bunch of interference when either of those modes are on. Connection issues at times. It only happens when I first put the headphones on. They seem to want to disconnect but after a while they continue to play music fine with no issues. Talking on the phone with these has been alright so far but I’ve had a few times where people can’t hear me very well.

R12JTQNZSU744L,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Execellent for Audiobooks,Jillalex,4,"I am glad I bought these, especially when they were on sale for ~$75. I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to music—also fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped out—into a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 15–30 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with. Since I know that, I wait to do the dishes when I'm off the phone.

R2ZTC75NUZSKYY,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent for the price when on sale,Amazon Customer,4,"Well let’s start off with I bought these on sale for around $80.If I would’ve paid the full amount of 150 I’m not going to lie and say I wouldn’t have been disappointed.Apple bought out beats audio a few years back so I expected more. The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren’t too compatible with Siri. I’m a delivery driver so I can’t always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won’t read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn’t always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That’s the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they’re decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don’t fit right.Another thing I might add is that they’re a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they’re worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would’ve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it’s nice that the case charges them. There’s also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it. On the case itself it only has a small light that turns red when low.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023",AFFMX6QW56DDKHV6PJ4JGPCEPVNA,1,21,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.12541973791973793,0.4566543816543817,Neutral

Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn’t do any good when their charging box is hours away and you’re out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that don’t sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable.

R1JBQTP05FUBYC,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price,DocBrown,5,"I’ve been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought I’d try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The “Quick setup guide” was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone. Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. I’m in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyone’s ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds. I can’t comment on failed bub issues yet, it’s too early, so we’ll see.I didn’t intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFWLU4KB7AN2ZGSOS3HICOKC44SQ,1,26,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.198081797235023,0.5572478238607271,Neutral
R1YXPTOD9CWT3I,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound at a good price,Ben W.,5,"I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didn’t want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasn’t really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. I’ll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I don’t think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only “issue” I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. It’s a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. I’ve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds I’ve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like it’s naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. It’s really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and it’s nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2021",AE7GOV7WYUWHSSVCGB5SQSMJI34Q,1,76,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.2552586206896552,0.4729269293924465,Positive
R19VWKTRIXU414,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice for ear buds,Crotorious,4,"I've used these ear buds for almost 2 years and strongly considered re-buying them once I started facing issues. When it comes to sound quality, they're good, and the latency is small, but you'll notice it's there. The best part of these ear buds has to be the battery life; these things last all day, and can be fully charged back up twice with the case. Though if you're looking for something with strong noise cancellation, you might want to consider looking for a different pair of ear buds, as these are really only capable of blocking out most speech. Overall, they're a pretty good pair of ear buds, but I do have a few problems with them.First, when they get to low battery, the text to speech voice will say ""Recharge headset"" just frequently enough to become mildly vexing. This is my primary complaint about these ear buds.Now mind you, I haven't treated these ear buds very well, they went through constant abuse and were used in sub-optimal environments the entire time I've owned them. The next two complaints are likely a result of my poor treatment of these.Second, after about two years of use, their connectivity isn't as great anymore; the range in which I can use these has dropped considerably. I used to be able to walk in my backyard without issues, but now I can barely leave the room without the connection dropping constantly.Lastly, the left earbud has recently developed a problem with connecting to the case; it seems the leads just don't connect half the time. This occasionally causes small inconveniences with the left ear bud turning on in the case and randomly hijacking the audio output of my pc, or it just doesn't end up charging and I'm stuck with a single ear bud until I manage to get it to charge again.Overall, this is a pretty good product. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a pair of long-lasting wireless earbuds and doesn't need the best sound quality or noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2023",AFRT3UTZANKCA7EGGKYQAVIXOJ5Q,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.17004429678848282,0.42378183831672206,Neutral
RB0NQXL4O1IZ,B08ZR5JB9G,1.0 out of 5 stars Only really lasted 8 months,Jake Boop,1,"Edit: originally rated 1 star as the earbuds that I received were open-box/used. I don’t think it’s fair to Sennheiser that my 1 star rating remains on here because that was a fault of Amazon. These earbuds sound great. Absolutely great. The connection seems to be good so far as well (I’ve seen a lot of negative reviews saying otherwise). They are very comfortable for my ears, I’m a Tool Maker/machinist and wear an earbud in one ear I all day and other earbuds that I’ve tried get uncomfortable or start to fall out but I have had no issues with fit at all. As far as the features on the app: the equalization is only a 3-band eq which is a shame, I’d much rather at least a 5 or 7-band eq but it’s better than nothing for sure. The side tone feature is supposed to use the mic to feed into the speaker, allowing you to hear outside talking, but it doesn’t seem to really work at all. I haven’t tested a phone call using them yet so maybe my mic is defective but I really wouldn’t care because I don’t need it. Overall this is a great pair of earbuds for the price.Original review: This item came in with the packaging already opened with another piece of tape over the original seal. The earbuds were covered in earwax and ear hair. Disgusting. If I wanted to buy an “open box/used” I would’ve selected that option instead of paying full price for it.Edit 3/14/2023: it's been 8 months and the connectivity issues have been becoming a decent problem. I take them out of the case and they won't connect, so I put them back it and take them out again and usually they'll connect after the second try. But lately I've been having to re-pair them to my phone. I'll take them out of the case and instead of the usual ""power on..... connected"" notification, it's just silence. And it's not as simple as just re-pairing them because they won't go into pairing mode unless I reset them. The battery life is also taking a dive.I started out really loving these, now I've been very disappointed because they're just such a hassle to deal with. With all of this, especially only being 8 months of use, I'm going to have to update my review from 5 stars to 2.Edit 7/17/2023: the right earbud just stopped working all together, it'll power on but refuses to connect to BluetoothEdit 1/24/2024: I've been trying to get as much use out of these just to justify the amount I spent on them before I replace them but all it has really given me is issues with connectivity and reliability. I expect any earbuds at this price range to last years, I should have no problem getting the same life out of earbuds that you would expect from a phone. I wish I would've just either returned them or thrown them away a long time ago. I'm going to start looking into replacements now. Adjusting my 2 star rating to a 1 star.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AE2R5XX5O7LVG57B7S2L22VH2QIA,1,10,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.12548654244306423,0.5291321601104211,Neutral
R32H19VXW9WGNF,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison with Momentum TW,Steve Kranyec,5,"I have a pair of CX's that are about 1.5 years old, and another set that I just recently purchased. In the middle, I have a pair of Momentum TW 3's that are ~6 months old. The TLDR here is that instead of repurchasing the Momentum, I got another pair of the CX's.I'm not an audiophile, and I mostly listen to audiobooks and make calls with earbuds, so I'm not going to be speaking to audio quality at all. For me, it's fine.My six month old Momentum's have a dead left earbud. Possibly this is anecdotal, but if anything I was more gentle with the Momentum's than the CX's, and the CX's have lasted three times as long. Yes, I drop them. Yes, the dead left Momentum died after the most recent drop. I'm not saying that earbuds should survive infinite drops, but in my experience, the CX's are more durable.I did really really like the ANC on the Momentum's. It killed the battery life, but when you need ANC, it was great to have. The pass-through audio was also awesome. It was almost like having a mini-hearing-aide.The CX's have been substantially less finicky than the Momentum. They connect quicker, I've had to reset them fewer times, and they seem to have better range.Between the (substantial) difference in price and the areas where the CX's are superior, I my opinion, the CX's are the better option. If dropping $150 every six months on earbuds is within your budget, I fully endorse the Momentums. For me, I need to have two working sets around at any given time as I wear them a substantial amount of my waking hours, so I'd rather swap to an overear model when I need ANC and go with the cheaper and more durable option.Quick recommendation -- splurge on the foam eartips. If you're like me and wear earbuds an unhealthy amount of time, they're substantially more comfortable. They do wear out, and they're not cheap, but the added comfort for long-wears is huge.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AGW3GZDQI7IIZB7FOD2IAOKUKMGA,1,8,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.21236559139784947,0.4553763440860215,Positive
R2M4WDO3B23EX,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, Horrible mic for calls",billyillyilly,3,"The good, these ear buds have a decent battery life, sit well in the ear without falling out (held with just the rubber insert), have good (not great) sound quality. A perfect example of the sound is with FFDP ""A little bit off"" which has extremely clean sound on a quality system. These ear buds lack the clean treble when the high hat hits and the deep tones of the bass. If you just want sound without worrying being an audiophile they're good.The bad, no noise cancelling... at all! During phone calls the mic is good in a quiet place. if there is ANY background noise, they will pick up that noise over your voice. I tried them multiple times in different cars and no matter the amount of road noise it drowned out my voice making conversations almost impossible unless I yelled. In an office environment the sound of the keyboard while typing would make conversation hard to understand for whoever was sorry enough to be on the other end of the call.I've been a Sennheiser fan for a long time and have had many of their headphones (still use some old wired buds CX100II for listening to music at work and love them), these are the first that I am returning due to be unusable for conversation.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2024",AHYASE5EWU5VJUIBY7QPUY6JS6FA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.12239898989898992,0.5176262626262627,Neutral
R1DTEWZS5AYFKH,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Not quite what I expected,Michal D. Wisteria,2,"So I'll start with the positive. The headphones are comfortable, the sound is great, and the battery life is pretty good too (supposed to be 9.5 hours, I got around 7). The bass felt great, skipping songs was a breeze, and the sound quality when answering calls on them was decent as well.The less great parts. After 6 1/2 hours or so, one headphone would die, usually the left one. Then the right would reconnect, and I could keep listening to things for a bit longer. But the biggest reason for the 2 star review is that my right earbud broke after about 11 months. I took good care of these headphones; they were usually in their case or in my ear. Last week I noticed the right earbud had no sound. I thought I just had to restart them and reconnect, but after a few tries of that I heard just hints of sound for half a second when moving the earbud in the ear, so I knew the audio wasn't working. But all the other features were. I could still pause, skip songs, etc with the right or left earbud. I went on my order page on Amazon and found the support section. There was a link to a product support site for Sannheiser... It was 404, page not found. There was a phone number too.... It was disconnected apparently. So now I have just a left side, good-sounding earbud.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2022",AEKYYYRFAHIBUCQXZMRBNGIQET3A,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.1815633291439743,0.41064446306381797,Neutral

R30839P76Q86K9,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, good physical construction outside. Elsewhere, not so much",Ben,3,"I've owned a few pairs of earbuds, all wired. I prefer over-ear headphones, but needed something small, portable and more discreet for work.These looked decent and my past experiences with Sennheiser sound quality also helped make my decision at the time.Sound quality is excellent, overall noise isolation is pretty good for no ANC, bass mids and highs are all present and clear. I do own several pairs of studio/reference headphones, which these obviously don't compare to, but they do manage to make a good account of themselves. Battery lifespan is excellent too and despite no wireless charging (not that it was a deal breaker in my case) the case charged very quickly. Just would have been nice if the charging cable was longer than the dinky one supplied.I used the smallest set of ear cushions, these are decently comfortable for up to a couple hours but do start to press against my ears for longer periods.Construction quality of the case and buds is decent, not too heavy but not feather light either. It's a shame that doesn't go into the internal electronics.First off, the Bluetooth connectivity is not a win. These would repeatedly disconnect themselves when bringing them out of ""sleep"" always one or the other bud. The Sennheiser Smart Control App does allow customization of the buds controls and a graphic equalizer. But it would keep proclaiming it needed a update, even though it was the most up-to-date version.Now these, when they paired, sounded great. After using these for nearly a year, the right bud suddenly had an internal fault and produced flakey, weak sound. That was not a Bluetooth issue, but rather the hardware either failing on a circuit level or a wire becoming loose due to a cold solder joint. I've owned plenty of headphones that are more cheaply made than these with worse sound quality but still function as intended.Looking up this problem seems to be inherit with the CX True Wireless, with complaints occuring anywhere from a few months of ownership to nearly a year or more. Replacements from Sennheiser have been described as having a repeat issue after a similar period of time, or are merely DOA.Shame, this isn't the Sennheiser I knew. Time for a different pair from a different manufacturer. Why bother going through the hassle of dealing with Sennheiser support only to get the same problem again eventually?","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2023",AEMJ3ANYCQ7TYZVKGNNX23MRZP6A,1,13,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.15572261072261073,0.5148085248085248,Neutral
R3RE1QI7DDJ44X,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Good BT earbuds,Photographer,4,"I generally prefer over the ear headphones, but I use earbuds only when I am exercising or doing yardwork. I bought a pair of name brand earbuds that was on sale during BF. Long story short, I had to return it because the sound quality was unacceptable.Rather than trying to find a diamond in haystack so to speak, I picked Sennheiser as it is a brand that I have good experience with. Furthermore, I opted for a higher price point than the rock bottom price I was hoping for.I forgo noise cancelling since I don't need it most of the time. Sonically, this pair of earbuds is very good, bearing typical Sennheiser sound of open and balance. It is still no match for my over the ear headphones, but it is also significantly cheaper. Sound quality is by far the most important aspect, other features are distant seconds and thirds.BT connectivity is, however, not Sennheiser's strength. It took some work to get it connected to all of my devices; I have a pair of Sennheiser over the ear BT headphone that behaves similarly. All of my cheaper BT earbuds have no BT connectivity issues. This weakness is not a showstopper.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AES7SSQNH3WNT4EAPENHZ67TRHBQ,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.22716666666666668,0.5640000000000001,Positive

Sure they had the metal case and metallic earbuds and all those sizes earbud tips but internal quality was bad a constant buzzing sound from a bad chip so I ordered a second pair still bad so returned both of them. I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser of course. When I bought these they had just come out no Amazon reviews but I took the chance cause I love my HD-25s and I haven’t looked back. I’m an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.Now yes these are 100% plastic but they don’t feel cheap and that plastic also means they don’t feel cold touching your skinYes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause I’ve had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.No wireless charging but who cares it’s USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work dayAnd the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but that’s inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.Could you get better sound sure but why it’s Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better soundIf you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then you’ll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones you’ll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2021",AFV7ZI225WCIGLKBRRZGPKITFUKQ,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.11752491694352162,0.47008121077888515,Neutral
R167YMGKLUDYU2,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Comprehensive rating: Sennheiser puts sound first (as usual),Scott Herron,4,"After years of using cheap-o headphones and dealing with cable noise, listening to music with the headphones feels like i'm hearing each song for the very first time. I'm hearing details in songs I never heard before, it honestly made me tear up. Incredibly clarity, customizable EQ, AMAZING sound for 100$. You could easily get something with comparable sound that costs twice as much. The sound is why I bought these. Sennheiser is a sound-focused brand. However, there are some places where these headphones cut corners that would not be a problem if you bought 200$+ dollar headphones.Security: I'm a dancer, and I want my headphones to stay on while I'm working in the studio. However, the earbuds aren't the most secure in my ears. They fly out during chainée turns, sometimes even just as I'm walking they'll fall out.Comfort: Not the most comfortable for hours of listening. After 2-3 hours of extended use, my ears ached. Changing up the plastic tips didn't help.Noise cancelling: I heard the ANC takes the edge off the sound quality, which is why I bought these and not the active noise cancelling ones. You can definitely tell. I can hear each step I take as I walk thudding in my ears. It's a little odd.Delay: I've tried to use these to watch tiktoks on my phone, and I've noticed a delay in the screen and the sound. I can see the person on my screen moving their mouth, but the words come out into my headphones a little later. It's not the worst, but it's noticeable.Overall: Great for audiophiles on a budget. The app allows you to customize, so there's something to love for everyone, whether you love a sparkling, bright treble or you're a total basshead. For sitting down and listening while you're at your computer, these are an excellent choice. If you're mainly wearing these for working out, maybe something else would suit your needs better. I do equal parts both, which is why I like these a lot. mp3 files can massacre the music quality, and bad headphones can make the sound even muddier. These are an excellent buy.

Having owned multiple headphones/earphones over the years this is product is in-line with Sennheiser – great sound quality for the price (they lowered it), but you pay with electronics/wiring issues. This maybe the last Sennheiser product I get for a while, but not in a good way…Goal: Portable “do everything” earphones with good sound quality. I wanted to be able use them around the home: smartphone music, binging Netflix, work computer for Zoom calls, etc. I’d been using whatever generic thing $40 could get; this time I decided to splurge past $100 (purchased at was $130 w/ points).Pros:• Sound quality. I’m not an audiophile, but I’ve owned 10+ headphones/earphones, different brands. The sound is lively, bass is strong without being overwhelming.• Case – form factor is great! Fits in my pocket, doesn’t looks scuffed after many months of use.• Battery life – lasts for many hours before needing a charge. Could probably use it 2-3 days of regular use before getting a warning.• Mic works – gets the job done.• Sennheiser app – you can change what device it connects to and adjust EQ settings.Cons:• Connectivity: atrocious. I’ve had to soft reset / hard reset this too many times. Bluetooth isn’t a new technology. This should be “set it and forget it.” * About 5% of the time, only 1 earphone connects. Disconnecting and reconnecting doesn’t do anything and I have to do a soft reset. * When using the app, it sometimes refuses to disconnect from the current device so I can connect to what the device I want. Real fun 3 minutes before your Zoom meeting! * Sometimes doesn’t “remember” how to connect to specific device(s). I’ve had to delete all pairings and reestablish connections twice so far in 9 months.• App: clunky. Randomly asks to update the firmware – no, Sennheiser! When I open this app, 99% of the time I want to switch devices! Do it right the first time!• Features: this thing lacks soooo many features that exist on $40 earphones today. For this product not to have things like wireless charging, noise cancellation, connecting to multiple devices, the only thing I can think of is a paywall (greed: wanting to upsell a more expensive product).","Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2022",AHKUJNCDT5O4CZ4IGDK2UBM7KLYQ,1,15,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.20612791679864853,0.48517519066299547,Positive

R1HOIBXMUJ3YZ4,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is good, shape is awkward",Jennifer C.,3,"These earbuds have a really good sound. And I love that there is an equalizer in the app so you can adjust it to sound the way you want it. They offer a lot of cool features that apparently not all earbuds have. You can change what the different taps do, but they are capable of answering your phone, raising and lowering the volume, fast forwarding, rewinding, or skipping tracks of songs, pausing and playing - all just buy tapping on the earbuds. Even though it is not one of their advertised features, they also do a very good job of noise canceling as long as they fit in your ear properly.So here's the downside that I found... These earbuds are large and square. Most ears are pretty round. I realize that all ears are shaped differently, but I have a hard time believing that these fit comfortably in most ears. If you're just sitting still at your desk or in the car, it's not too bad. But if you smile really big, they come loose, and If you lean over, they fall out of your ear entirely. When the Stem is seated properly in your ear, The big square part rubs uncomfortably against the outer ear. For this reason alone I am debating whether to return these, or Just suffer with it since I mostly use them in the car or at work. These could be great earbuds if they were more organomically designed.One last note - I don't have a lot to compare it to. But they advertise that the battery life is superior on these, and i'm not convinced. Now I admit I had them running for most of an 8 hour workday. But I had to switch between the left ear and the right ear while one of them was charging in the case, i'd use the other one.

I have had pretty shoddy luck with headphones, but I had heard good things about this brand, so I thought I’d give them a go. Their sound is overall above average from what I’ve listened to. They’re not super bassy like the Beats and Raycons I’ve had, which in some ways are better. I think a lot of people’s problems with these is that they aren’t proper Audiophile material like some of Sennheiser’s other products, but if you’re looking for wireless buds, you probably aren’t really looking for the greatest sound on the market.I like the software that these use. The app lets you tweak the bass, mids and highs a bit so you can get get the sound a bit more to your liking. It also lets you switch between sources more easily than some other Bluetooth headphones.I will say that these aren’t the most ergonomic earbuds ever, they fit just fine normally, but if you try to sleep with them, or put any pressure on your ear with a hat or something, they really dig into your ears, but that’s a non issue to most people.The noise cancellation is decent, but I’m pretty sure there’s not any tech behind it like with the AirPods, I think these just plug up your ears so you don’t hear the outside noise, and they do that pretty well.The case is pretty good too.

R2DX8KHP8703FK,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars This one doesn't live up to the Sennheiser name,Nicky,2,"I had a Sennheiser full over-the-ear headphones some years ago and was satisfied with it. I bought this one on Black Friday and have been using it for several days. I now have three pairs of earbuds: Apple AirPods, SkullCandy and this one, which took me the most time to pair and connect.1) The small paper guide conveniently didn't mention that a small film on the mental contact must be peeled off. The charging case showed green light after a couple hours charging but I couldn't get them to connect. It was only after researching the questions section that I learned about this step (so apparently others were confused too).2) The shape of the earbuds make it difficult to grab and pull them out of the charging case. Each time it takes more than one try.3) No indicator light on the front of earbuds themselves to show the battery level. My SkullCandy (much cheaper but equally good sound quality) has indicator light on the earbuds. It would become red to tell me to put it back in the charging case.4) To connect to a device for the first time is confusing. A YouTube clip tells me to watch the little light in the back to blink red/blue to indicate it's ready to pair/connect. But when I tried to connect with a second device (after disconnecting from the first one), it didn't blink. The guide shows to put fingers on the earbuds (after inserting into the ears) to put it in paring mode. The SkullCandy doesn't require any additional step: after the earbuds are taken out of the case, a voice tells you that it's ready to connect.5) It won't let you switch from one device to another easily. When I turn off the Bluetooth on my iPad and tried to switch to my cellphone (with earbuds still in my ears), I can't connect right away. I wound up having to put them back in the case and then take them out to connect to the second device (unlike SkullCandy, which stays in pairing mode and lets you connect to the 2nd device right away).All in all, It's not worth the value compared to a cheaper but better product like SkullCandy.Added 12/27/2022: Now that I’ve used for more than three weeks (bought on Black Friday), I should downgrade the rating from my initial 3 stars to 2 stars. I finally managed to connect it with my laptop after several attempts but it seemed random and I still don’t know how it happened. And it happened several times that one of the earbuds would lose sound for no apparent reason while I was using them. I would need to take them out of my ears, put them back into the case, took them out to reconnect again. Or sometimes only one earbud got connected with the device after taking both out of the charging case. I would not buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2022",AGUCYTK4WI5QN4KWJ7K43QZ6LSKQ,1,5,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.0981785714285714,0.4117619047619048,Neutral

When they were brand new on the market they cost a lot more. A lot of news channel interviews are with guests not in the studio. They're at their home or office so the sound is of poor quality. I listen to a lot of news in Spanish so with the other factors mentioned it's hard for me to understand. Sometimes there will even be a music overlay which really makes it hard for me to understand. These Sennheisers clean it all up. Just beautiful.Amazon shipped 'em to me in South America right to my door with no problem whatsoever.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2023",AG4X5EGQM4ARYEQN5PWBPLWF2BLA,1,1,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.14107427660059244,0.4148382319434951,Neutral
R2IR64A8EIRYJQ,B08ZR5JB9G,3.0 out of 5 stars Good at first,Nathan,3,"So, I have bought alot of earbuds. In the last year I've probably got 5 pairs, because most of them share the same issue. Connection problem.Eventually most earbuds will start disconnecting from my phone, ToZo, ILuv, Senheiserner, ect ect...These earbuds are no exception.Now for the first two weeks these earbuds were perfect, they had great sound, great connectivity, the app worked without issue.But after week two, they started not connecting to my phone, sometimes they would cut out randomly, and I had to restart them. For cheap earbuds, this is expected. Not for $100 pair. However I had bought so many, I was tired of it and gave these the benefit of the doubt.Here I am a month and a half later and the issue alas only gotten worse. I don't know if it's Senheiserners fault, or the particular pair I got, but either way I couldn't put up with it any longer, thankfully Amazon offered me a full refund, and I intend on buying the ""Google Pixel Buds A-Series"" (the ones I was originally going to get)I really wanted these earbuds to work, and I took perfect care of them. I didn't let them over charge, I never dropped them or tossed them once. So I know for a fact that fault wasn't mine own atleast.If you want good earbuds of a similar price, I dunno, this is the most expensive pair I've owned.If you want good earbuds of a cheaper price try the Mpow M30 Plus, I've had that pair for almost two years and they have failed me only twice in all that time (and it was my fault). Or maybe I genuinely just got a bad pair, I don't know. I know when these earbuds worked, they were excellent.I have had great experiences with Senheiser in the past, this is the first time they've let me down.Hopefully this is the last negative Earbud review I ever have to make, we'll see Goggle Pixel Buds A-Series, I'm coming for you next, don't fail me too.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2022",AFHOTNY7QTDBDCLJRYRG2OVX3S4Q,1,2,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.1579268292682927,0.5168699186991871,Neutral

Big fan of the design as well both in regards to the earbuds and the case. As great as they sound I ended up going with a different pair for one reason, comfort. These feel terrible. They’re on the heavy side due to the thick build( which allows for bigger batteries) and keeping them in your ears is a chore.

For her, using these for phone calls is essential as she needs her hands free to be “hands on.” They performed well on both audio dimensions.

RJOZ6MJ0Y7WO9,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Great value for money pair of earbuds.,Yash Tike,4,"Sennheiser always makes some great audio products, and this one is no exception. It is priced pretty competitively, and gives great bang for the buck. The battery life is good, sound quality is great, and passive noise cancellation is also fairly decent, but might have to turn the volume up if in a crowder place. The only gripes I have with it are that the bluetooth drivers are not great, and I have faced several connectivity issues. They are also quite a bulky pair, and fit a bit awkwardly in the ear because of their shape and size, so you do start feeling the fatigue after a couple of hours in listening sessions.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023",AHS2Q6FGZSSQWZPKGWR5E7UGEERQ,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.27638888888888885,0.6722222222222222,Positive

I assume the mic is good on these considering the other end never asks twice or asked me to repeat what I've said. I usually have on a single bud while using and that works fine for both listening to music and calling. The battery life is fantastic. I get better mileage out of it compared to the Galaxy buds. Personally I think these are more comfortable than the Galaxy buds and the sound quality is superior to the Galaxy buds. That might not be the case for everyone. The Sennheiser CX is a bit bulky, so angling and fit I could see not working out for everyone. They are snug for me and generally a great fit, however I have had an instance of it falling off once or twice. The best part is price in my opinion, beats the Galaxy buds in sound quality and is cheaper. Personally I like it's design, but it being a bit bulky they aren't the most discreet.

R2FY7S14FVDT3C,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Useful for listening to music at work,Jeremy Davis,4,"I’ve used these earbuds for about a week now. Sound quality is very good, however the bass is a bit lacking, which I was expecting when I purchased these.The noise cancellation is passive, which was something I was actively looking for in earbuds. I work in an environment where I communicate frequently with coworkers, so I didn’t want too much bass or any active noise cancellation.The battery life and charging time has been stellar. I can wear these from 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM without much concern for the battery life. I usually charge them while I eat lunch, which essentially ensures they will last me the whole day.These headphones do utilize an application to update firmware. The app is pretty standard. It’s easy to use, and it lets you customize the sound balance. It is a bit annoying that you have install an app and a firmware update for these.Touch controls are relatively standard as well. The app does let you customize these controls, but since I have a smart watch, the only touch function I use is the play/pause single tap.Overall, I am very happy with the product.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2022",AHKLDEPJRNY6SHU4E6VC2TTCJWKA,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.11606625258799172,0.484223602484472,Neutral
R36KYYVGPMLU43,B08ZR5JB9G,3.0 out of 5 stars Not what I'd expect from Sennheiser...,Cody Groat,3,"I bought these after I lost my JBL Live 300's. Was looking for something equally as good but for a bit cheaper. Stumbled across these and looked at some reviews. Flossy Carter's review is what gave me the go ahead, but boy was he wrong on this one.These are extremely cheaply made (case and earbuds feel horrible to the touch), the earbuds are uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes, the sounds quality is nothing as you'd expect from Sennheiser. And the horrid app is nearly unusable.Normally I'd excuse the sound quality when you can set your own equalizer, but the app to do that doesn't work half the time. When you launch it, it just flat out doesn't connect to the earbuds. It will show them for a second but then say connection failed. If you get pass this, the app is extremely slow and buggy. Even if the app worked, the equalizer only includes bass, mids, and highs so you can't fully customize it to your liking.For some good points about these earbuds. They are lightweight and don't move around easily in your ear. The magnets to secure the earbuds and close the case feel great. The touch controls are very responsive. The sound queues and tones are clear and easy to understand. And the battery life is good + it charges quickly.So give these earbuds a pass and go with the JBL Live 300's. Much better sound quality, and an app that works. They are $150 retail but frequently go on sale for $100 (I got them for $75 on amazon). You'll also be getting auto play/pause, and a slightly better water resistance rating at IPX5.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2021",AFL7DAIS7RHT23VDIZF4BZKBABWQ,1,44,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.17024147727272726,0.5325520833333334,Neutral
R3I5RQ4VA1B53P,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Bang For Your Buck,Josh B,5,"I like a good sounding headphones/earbuds. I think most of us do, at least anyone looking into something like Sennheiser.That being said, I usually go to Bose, because they have fantastic sound, and, they are the most comfortable for me. The wingtips really help keep them in my ears, and since they're soft silicone, it's comfortable.I typically don't like in ears with this design. They annoy my ears to the point that I just can't wear them for more than an hour. These on the other hand are actually quite comfortable. They aren't the most comfortable thing on the planet, but I find myself able to wear them for hours at a time without feeling any fatigue.The noise canceling does leave a little to be desired, but it's definitely present. It doesn't suck the world out like a nice pair of over ears or a really, really nice sent of ANC in ears. But, for the price point, they weren't so far away from things double, or even almost triple the price. They're great.The best thing about these earbuds, though, is their sound quality. They sound absolutely fantastic. Now, if you're a basshead, they probably aren't quite for you. But if you want to hear the nice boomy bass, punchy kids, and sparkly highs; these are fantastic. You can hear the low end a bit better with the bass boost profile, you can even EQ them in app to your preferences. But for me, the take home with these was the solid sound signature. I could hear all of the lower undertones of sound work in the high end, while getting a nice clear sounding low end. Again, if you're really looking for that low end - low kids punch, these probably won't do it for you. But if you want all aspects of your song to stand out equally, these are great.At this price, if you're thinking about getting them. I say go for it.

I tested it with different types of music (rock, hip-hop, spanish, etc), as well as some podcasts. While the sound quality across the board is good, it didn't outperform a $50 pair of Enacfire E90 earbuds I had before they stopped working. When it comes to bass, the old E90's actually did BETTER than these. The comfort is decent, and aren't heavy enough to fall off your ears. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the battery life since these STOPPED working less than 24 hours after they were delivered!Oh and about the failure, I mainly blame their (stupid) ""Smart Control"" app for this. Like I said before, the earbuds worked fine and paired quicky...until I used this dumpster fire of an app. At first, I was able to link the earbuds with the app and then I tried to update the firmware since it was available. Big, BIG MISTAKE. Even though the earbuds were (supposedly) at 90% battery and were recently charged with a fully charged case, I was instructed to put them them back into the case in order to start the update. After doing so and waiting an hour, the earbuds have refused to go into Bluetooth pairing mode.***UPDATE 08/22/2021***After contacting Sennheiser support via email, they suggested that I get a replacement pair, which is what I did. After getting them, I have to say, I now LOVE these earbuds! I don't know why, but this pair sounds a LOT better than the first ones I got. I can now safely say thay sound better than anything else I've tried, including my old E90's. Pairing was simple and fast, using a single earbud was effortless, and the range is fantastic.While I didn't get the 9 hrs of battery life that was advertised, the most I've gotten so far is about 7.5 hrs, which is still great for true wireless earbuds. Regardless of what you listen to, these earbuds sound amazing and have a great amount of bass. While a few have said that these are too heavy for their ears, it wasn't the case for me. I work in a warehouse where I'm constantly on the move, and I NEVER experienced a moment where I felt like these were going to fall off. That being said, I stand by my previous comment where I say that these won't fall off your ears, even if you're moving around. These are rated as IPX4 water resistant, which I'm going to say is legit since the warehouse does get hot and as a result, I do get pretty sweaty.***UPDATE #2, 09/10/2021***I once again find myself HATING these earbuds! After working perfectly for a few weeks, the left earbud of the REPLACEMENT (2nd) pair I got stopped working. Just like the 1st pair, I tried multiple resets, both soft and factory, and I get no audio from left side whatsoever. I also checked my devices' settings and can confirm that they work perfectly and are not the issue. At this point, I probably won't bother contacting support again and will just get rid of them. $130 in the trash thanks to Sennheiser!","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2021",AGCJFB7PLYJWNNGPHSOJ4A2LKAEA,1,57,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.16820672713529858,0.43977702191987905,Neutral

So I decided to try these Sennheisers out as a replacement, and I'm really glad I did. The clarity and overall sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the Airpods. And the battery life is far superior as well. I take long walks every day with these, and only need to charge them maybe once every other week? Phenomenal.My only two gripes would be 1. the size of the case, which is somewhat bulky when shoved into a jeans pocket, and 2. the rubber tips that are included. Although they do provide 3 sizes (small, medium, large), I found all sizes of the Sennheiser tips to be too shallow for my ear canal, causing the buds to fall out rather easily.

I bought these in April when I started a new job because I would be taking a train regularly. I wanted something affordable but didn't want to sacrifice the sound quality that I was enjoying before, with a much better battery quality. These really haven't disappointed. They're not quite as good sound as the MOMENTUMS, but they are still very good for $70. I reckon most other brands you'd have to be spending at least $150 for this quality of sound. The battery life is incredible on them and they're my daily use when I'm commuting. The touch controls are great, much more intuitive than the MOMENTUMs. Their size is a massive improvement over the first MOMENTUMS, they do not stress my ears nearly as bad. Couldn't have been happier with this purchase. Sennheiser is the only audio company I purchase from, and they have rarely missed for me.

R1TIH76K4BX9O3,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Painfully Mediocre,Lui,2,"Where to start. The (8 HOUR MAX) battery life is valid for only one of the earbuds, the other dies in half the time causing the other to also start spewing its ""Battery Low"" message until you set it back to charge. They say 27 hour only because you get about 3 Charges from the case, which is also Sad. The material they're made of (including the case) provides ZERO grip so you'll most likely have them simply slipping out of your grasp AND your ears. They refuse to stay in even during something as simple as a light walk, you'll find yourself constantly having to push them back in place. As for the connection, it's Horrid. As many other reviews state, sometimes one bud doesn't connect and you have to factory reset them about three times in a row to fix the issue. The Range is hot garbage.

R1P3YQA1FN8IFK,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive for my use!,Terry P.,5,"I cannot comment on noise cancellation with these earbuds because I don’t care about that. For my use on my iPad Air for listening to music and YouTube videos of all kinds these are perfect. I can EQ them nicely. I have a musical background with degrees in performance and theory and have a good ear. These suit me just fine. My hearing is a bit lessened at my age 68 but not much. I can hear vocals, instruments etc with excellent detail in the mids, highs, lows. I am currently listening to Angelina Jordan exclusively right now and it almost sounds as if she is here with me. I know her well as my dearest friend and have an intimate knowledge of her voice in person. Through these Sennheisers her voice sounds great. Sennheiser has done it for me. I am totally satisfied. She and I compared them the other day to a pair of very high end buds given her by the record company as a gift. The ones she had were at least four times the cost of these Sennheiser but neither she nor I could hear much difference. Of course her hearing is much better than mine but still she agreed with my assessment. Hope this is helpful.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2022",AF5STGCM7QT7T27TZ2UWEARUBQMA,1,10,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.3461988795518207,0.5742773109243698,Positive

I have many sennheiser headphones and old cx wired buds, so i figured the cx wireless would be a reliable choice. I opted for the regular cx versus the plus and the momentum because ANC does not matter to me.I’m beyond happy with going with the CX wireless buds. Exactly the quality sound and build I was expecting from sennheiser. I’ve listened for about a week to a variety of my favorite genres and these buds are so great all around!There is also a sennheiser app that gives a bass boost and podcast mode. I don’t use these and find the bass boost mode to be too much. But the app has a 3 band eq. With a little treble boost I found my sweet spot.

This means that when they are on your ears or in your ears, you feel like the sound is outside of your ears instead of right in your eardrum. This creates a soundstage with more depth and clarity. These are not the headphones to bump your trap music to. These are headphones to enjoy great acoustic music, classical music, jazz, watch movies, and enjoy some rock music. With rock music, it should be understood that you will get a nice open sound, but that you will not be getting the blistering loudness that comes with other headphones, especially wired headphones. In some ways this is a better things, especially in regards to your long term ear health.I am 2 days into enjoying them, so I will update if the charging and individual earbud dying issue comes up.

For the price of these, the sound quality is ""bussin',"" as the kids say. I honestly don't even know what to expect from a higher dollar bluetooth headphone. I really enjoy the equalizer that's on the Sennheiser app. It has many presets and also allows you to create your own preset based on what sounds better in certain situations and certain genres of music you are listening to at that time. My only complaint is the noise cancellation. Actually it's not even a complaint because these headphones don't claim to have noise cancellation.

I like the charging case and it seemed to keep a charge for a long time. I only tested them for a week or so, but I didn't need to charge the case much in that time period. The bad- the worst thing to me was that they kept falling out of my ears and even the smallest cover for the ear bud part wouldn't fit in my ear. That might be just my ears but it actually would start hurting if they were in for longer than 20 min or so. And they fell quite often. I also found when trying to use them for a call, the person on the other end couldn't hear me.

I've had to do this every few weeks, sometimes even a few times in a week and pairing them has proven to be much more difficult than it should be. Often it said the earbuds couldn't be paired even though they were turned on and full battery. Another thing, my left earbud will die almost an hour before my right one does, and I make sure to clean them well so they charge.My left earbud also has the most connection issues as recently I'll hardly tap it or move my head and the earbud will lose connectivity and buffer a lot.

I use them for several hours every day and this happens three or four times each week. If there is no audio for a few minutes, they disconnect but they will re-connect with a single click which is a minor inconvenience. However, they also just stop working randomly and will not re-connect at all. That could be a problem connecting with Bluetooth, but often one earbud will continue working when the other earbud is dead and must be re-charged. That proves that it is not a Bluetooth problem but a problem with the earbuds. Even after recharging, the dead earbud will not always re-connect easily. Frequently I need to remove them from my Bluetooth list then re-pair them which is a major inconvenience. I used to have a pair of wireless Sennheiser headphones that also would not stay connected.

First impression of the sound: crisp, clear, not quite loud enough (for me), but the low end is sorely lacking. Treble perhaps too bright. The EQ inside the app is pretty clever and helped improve the sound, but I was still hoping for more...ooomph...presence...<insert other audiophile words>.

I use them daily and love them for calls in particular. I have very bad hearing and these ear buds keep me from having to crank the volume up on calls. They also pick up sound very well which is great because I'm usually working on something when I get a call. The sound quality for music is fantastic as well. Unlike a lot of other brands, these ear buds are great for all types of music, not just loud bass-driven music as the mid-range is well represented in the mix when playing music. I prefer to listen to music with these headphones over all of my other headphones and speakers as the quality can't be beat. Sennheiser makes fantastic headphones, on par with industry leaders. I cannot recommend these particular ear buds enough. They're so great that I would not want to go a day without them.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2022",AEPEY7RCI6RA3JDWJUCRAVO3Y7WA,1,2,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Sennheiser CX True Wireless Earbuds,0.23543859649122809,0.5517543859649123,Positive

They are the only headphones that I've ever had just cease operating. I returned them, and my experience with my second pair has been a complete nightmare.The- Inconsistent battery life- Drastically different EQ on left and right sides- Poorly designed charging caseAre just a few small issues I've had. The main issue is that sometimes one or both headphones will stop working or desync from my phone for no reason and with no solution. I have gone months (Multiple times) with only one headphone working while the other one blinks red and green like a Christmas tree only to fix itself randomly months later. Again, this has happened several times with both headphones. Sometimes for days, sometimes for months. They have also reset any settings that I had changed in the Sennheiser app, so that's useless.And to add insult to injury, they sound just as good as the $30 TaoTronics I had a few years back. Not bad... But you won't be catching any fine detail in your music. Definitely not worth the asking price.Just don't buy these. They are complete e-waste, and I have read similar problems in others' reviews. They are a total waste of money. Get some Anker SoundCores or something.

They will work with my phone, but getting them to connect to my switch is a pain, and when trying to use them when connected to my Surface pro they just don't work at all.

Very annoying while at work or at home, and the firmware update did not fix this.Volume being weak, with no ANC, means you'll hear things around you if they're notably loud, unlike their other wired or wireless options.

R2EFM9QEJB3NTK,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Sound and Functionality,ETaylor,5,"I am impressed with everything about these earbuds.TL;DR--Great sound quality. Quite comfortable. Surprisingly good app. Easily customizable features. Consistent, reliable bluetooth connectivity. Overall, outstanding value.BACKGROUND: The last set of earbuds I owned were non-brand wireless buds that cost about $40 a couple years ago, and they were garbage. In the meantime, I've used a pair of compact Bose on-ear wireless headphones, which are incredibly comfortable and provide amazing sound clarity, but I wanted something smaller and easier to carry around for use at the office. All further remarks about these Anker earbuds are in comparison to my Bose headphones.SOUND: The clarity and quality of sound these earbuds produce is remarkable. It's not quite on the level of the Bose overall, but I never expected it to be on account of these being earbuds and less than half the price.However, the bass that these earbuds pump out is what really blew me away on first use! The Bose headphones are actually a bit weak on bass, whereas these earbuds provide an impressive thump without distorting or sacrificing clarity across the rest of the frequency range. I'm not saying they have good bass *for ear buds,* I'm saying they pump out the bass, *period.*For reference, this is based on listening to EDM tracks from Pretty Lights and Tycho.COMFORT: They're buds, which are understandably less comfortable for a lot of folks than on-ear or over-ear headphones. But for earbuds, they are quite comfy.The rubber pieces that actually go in your ear are soft and pliable, and they come with FIVE different sizes of those. They fit snugly without feeling like they're stretching my ear canal.I haven't done any running or other major activity with them, but I've never felt at risk of one falling out while just walking around my office.NOISE ISOLATION/CANCELATION: This is actually the first set of noise canceling headphones/earbuds I've ever owned, so I can't compare that functionality to anything else, but I will say this: My office runs white noise machines all the time. When these connect to my phone and the noise cancellation begins, the drone from those machines (which I don't even realize I notice beforehand) suddenly goes completely silent.They also effectively reduce the sound of co-workers talking nearby--not completely, but far more than just putting plugs in my ears would do. (Speaking of noise isolation--just blocking sound by plugging your ears--these do more than any earbuds I've previously owned.)Finally, the different modes of noise cancellation that can be set through the app (more on that shortly) seem reasonably effective, but I haven't put them to the test in a variety of environments yet.BATTERY LIFE: I don't remember this being stated in the description, maybe because it's a given for wireless earbuds nowadays, but the carrying case functions as a power bank for these babies.I don't know how many times the case will charge the earbuds before needing to be recharged itself because I haven't drained it yet (in two weeks of using them every other day for 2-3 hours per day). When that time comes, I think it's neat that the case can charge wirelessly.It also has a microUSB charging port and comes with a cable, the other end of which is standard USB. Nothing comes with wall bricks anymore, but I guess they figure everyone has a few spare ones around by now.TECHNOLOGY: My first thought on being able to access some of the settings/features of these earbuds only through the app was, ""UGH, another product-specific app?! *grump*"" BUT, this app is remarkably sleek and easy to use. And I say that as someone who works for a software company.Setting the noise cancellation mode and customizing the on-board controls (what happens when you tap the earbuds in different ways during use) is very easy to do. The app also has a sound test feature to help make sure you're wearing the earbuds correctly and have the right size squishy ear piece on them.After initially pairing them with my phone via Bluetooth, the connectivity has worked flawlessly. When I remove them from the case, they connect right away. When I put them back in and close the case, they are disconnected. Every time. No fiddling with settings or having to re-pair.That consistent reliability is very nice, especially for phone calls. If the buds are in my ears, that's where the call comes in. If they're in the case, it comes through the phone speaker. No juggling devices or frantically pressing buttons to sort out where the sound will come out of next. The calls are clear, and the built-in microphones must pick up my voice well enough because I've had no complaints from anyone on the other end.I haven't tested the Bluetooth range on them because my phone is always on me when I'm using them.CONSTRUCTION: Solid build, clear attention to detail. The earbuds pop into the case with a satisfying little snap.The magnet that holds them in is very secure, so even with the case open I'm not worried about them falling out, but not so strong that they're difficult to remove.The case itself is terrifically compact and sturdy. The lid shuts securely, and would clearly protect the earbuds while bouncing around in a purse or backpack all day.SUMMARY: These are great earbuds. For the price, they're amazing earbuds. I know the technology is always advancing, but these do SO MUCH for $70, and they do all of it remarkably well. I've been going out of my way to recommend them to people, which is why I've written this novel of a review. If you've read this far, I certainly hope you've found it helpful. :)","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2022",AE32IG42QNFSNTCIBWQBOOSMU6PA,1,327,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.22944880952380955,0.5137007936507936,Positive
R3W4U2A2AS5ZWU,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars If you're looking for an excellent quality earbud that covers all the bases then you've found it!,LYCollins,5,"I have tried countless brands and styles of over-the-ear headphones, wired earbuds, wireless earbuds, and all the in between. I need something that works at the gym, on airplanes, while gardening, washing dishes, and driving. The Soundcore Life P3 is the first I've found that can do it ALL.The active noise cancellation is superb, and you can control it via the app or just by touch of the earbuds. I've had other earbuds that say they cancel noise but they don't even come close to these.The range of connection while listening to music, etc. all over my house (inside and outside) is important for me. I don't always bring my phone when I am going around the house, garage, yard, and these stay connected at least 90% of the locations i roam to at the edges of my yards--through closed doors.The quality of connection while in conversation is excellent, no complaints. The water resistance holds up to the IPX5 standard which is just what i need due to sweat & sometimes I (carefully) wash my face with them in.The battery life is excellent. They last a few days without needing to be plugged back into an outlet. The earbuds recharge in 10-15 minutes with the portable charging case. The charging case is even something to rave about! It is small and soft to the touch yet sturdy & durable. I do wish the magnetic closure was a little stronger but that is only because i often drop things & if you drop the case then the earbuds pop out (half the time). But I can honestly say that is my only complaint about these earbuds.I realize I sound like a paid advertisement but I am not - I just LOVE these earbuds. The quality is fantastic, and I think the price is just right: a little expensive but completely worth it.The customer service is the cherry on top! After a couple months of heavy use I had a fluke problem with one earbud and the customer service resolved the issue 100%. They did make me do some extra troubleshooting that was a little painful, and it did resolve the issue for a little while. After that earbud stopped working again I contacted customer service and they could not have been easier or quicker to completely rectify the situation. I am now even more fanatical about this brand.If you're looking for an excellent quality earbud that covers all the bases then you've found it--buy these.It is almost 3 years since I first purchased these & I stand by them 100%. They have taken countless drops, been stepped on a few times, sustained water submersion and still give amazing quality of sound, noise cancellation, and battery life. I have been getting comments about the mic quality on phone calls lately so I will soon replace them as i often use them for work. I will replace them with a new pair of Soundcores!","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2022",AENEP4XMMU5V3DHYS522PP5FIDGA,1,7,Color: Coral Red,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.11314935064935065,0.5070887445887445,Neutral
R1PXZ3RO471MZU,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Unexpectedly satisfied! Sound quality, battery life, accessibility all great.",Naglfarslayer,4,"UPDATE (3 October 2022):After less than a year of a typical life (no major damage), each earbud has alternated between working and not working over the last month. For the first two weeks, the left earbud was silent, then it suddenly came back to life and the right one went silent within a couple of days and remains so today. Both headphones finally failed during a Zoom meeting this morning and have not yet been resurrected.While these have been excellent headphones, I am disappointed to experience a serious failure like this after LESS THAN ONE YEAR of responsible use and care.These were everything I wanted in new, EXPENSIVE (>$30) headphones.TL;DR: Great sound range (incl. prominent bass), satisfactory battery life (3-4 hours per charge; case gives ~2-3 recharges), and easy accessibility (two-step connection to device; the SoundCore app has a good widget). They are acceptable for voice calls, however they seem to pick up a lot of ambient background noise (papers shuffling, keyboard clicking, etc.), and my callers say the sound quality is better on my iPhone SE 2020 without the headphones, than with them.ONLY COMPLAINTS: very rarely but consistently, the sound will cut out for ~2 seconds before coming back - I believe this occurs when too many other wireless devices are nearby, as it has not happened at all the past 2 hours I've sat here at my work desk after-hours, but it happens every 1-2 minutes in the gym around many people wearing wireless headphones - CONSULT OTHER REVIEWS to see what the consensus is; I'm used to it by now - it's not a surprise and I miss very little in that small 1-2 sec window.NOTE that in-ear headphones naturally block out a lot of sound; 'Transparency Mode' helps to artificially add back in some environmental noise, but it is difficult to reliably hear people talk nearby.OVERALL: I'm very satisfied with the Anker Life P3. The sound quality is very nice (for a normie lol), the battery stays alive for several hours and charges quickly when returned to the case, and it easily pairs with Bluetooth devices.The origin story:I was reluctant to switch to wireless headphones due to the high prices and ease of losing track of them. I had to switch due to upgrading phones (iPhone SE to iPhone SE 2020, can't you tell I'm a cheapskate lol), and exhaustively researched wireless headphones to find a budget-end pair that still boasted good quality.My priorities were something reliable that would survive through long days in the (chemistry) lab, and during workouts (generic 30-45 min weightlifting or cardio). Many reviews recommended the Anker Life P3 as a solid entry on the lower-mid price range, although AirPods tended to remain the gold standard albeit at a notably higher price. Due to the consistent recommendation between reviewers (website and YouTube), I decided to go for it.The Anker Life P3 met my purchasing goals to a T (and I ride Boston's T system now, so I would know!).FIT: The fit feels nice, and the multiple pairs of rubber ear adapters give a chance for all ear sizes to feel comfortable. They don't fall out easily even when I run (both on the treadmill and *real* running), and they feel secure as I walk around. Minor irritation when my ears decide the 'foreign objects' need to leave, although this is rare.SOUND: I've listened to songs I've played for most of my life, and these earphones have brought out parts of the arrangement I have NEVER heard before. The bass is strong, so the full range of sound is there (no 'weak' or 'high' headphone sound here). In my opinion, the sound is powerful but balanced. Equalizers can probably tweak the sound if you prefer a different mix, but these bad boys can sure thump if you want them to!BATTERY: I usually give up before these headphones do. My typically listening sessions go between 30 min to 3 h and I've never had the batteries die on me. They *feel* like they quickly recharge when returned to the case, which provides another 2-3 full charges. The case can be separately recharged using the USB-C to USB-A cable provided; this takes longer, so charge the case overnight and it will keep the headphones charged for the entirety of the next day. Hardcore music marathoners may be less enthused by the battery life, but the Anker Life P3 has a longer lifespan than me!ACCESSIBILITY: I find the Life P3 to be easy to handle, although the initial linking was a bit confusing (and I already forgot how I did it!). When the headphone case is open, the three front lights turn/stay on for a few seconds. Then, the lights ignite in an alternating pattern, which is when the headphones are seeking a Bluetooth partner. On a device that knows the headphones, clicking on 'Soundcore Life P3' on the Bluetooth list will initiate the pairing, and then you're ready to go! To disconnect, you can remove it from the device, turn off the device Bluetooth, or return the headphones to the case and close the case. Unpaired headphones can be immediately paired with another device without having to be returned to the case. Re-cased headphones will immediately pause music/video streaming on the paired device (on Apple products, in my experience). The 'Soundcore' app for phones (haven't seen it for Mac) is very useful, as it provides some EQ's and the Noise Cancellation or Transparency modes. It also provides a widget for quick access to the Cancellation/Transparency/Normal modes for convenient toggling without having to open the app.Note: The headphone stems have two or three swipe features. I use these sparingly and have not investigated them further. One gesture skips to the next audio (song skip or 'next YouTube video in queue') which is convenient when desired; sometimes it takes me several attempts to gesture in a way the headphones will recognize, but more practice will likely help that.OTHER: As with all in-ear headphones, these naturally block a good 70% of external noise, and loud music will take out another 10-15% on top of that. It is near-impossible to hear people speaking to me with these headphones in; at most I get an inaudible, deep rumble that tells me someone is trying to speak to me. This is fine if you're prepared for it, but it is inconvenient to remove one headphone every time someone speaks to me - consider your intended use and how common this will be for you. The noise cancellation works very well, IMO, as only minor vibrations and deep sounds come through; I've experienced no intelligible talking in the background with that feature on, and bus/subway rides only have a deep hum characteristic of public transportation.ONE COMPLAINT: As mentioned in the TL;DR above, the sound does cut out for 1-2 seconds rarely, although this becomes more common in crowded ares with a higher density of wireless headphones. My hypothesis is that too much Bluetooth air traffic makes it difficult to stay connected to the signal, but I have no idea. This has only been a major issue in the gym, where the phenomenon seems frequent and consistent; I've only taken these to the gym two or three times, though. Check other reviews!OVERALL: I am quite satisfied with these headphones. $70 for exactly what I wanted? YES! When I inevitably drop one of the headphones down a storm drain, I will definitely look for another pair of Anker Life P3, or consider their other similar products.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2022",AHRON4BBXZLET3OZA2LRPMNSJ3ZA,1,233,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.12677056754871327,0.4725587473600718,Neutral

R25ZRMEWRUH6GT,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid earbuds - must buy,Matt W,5,"Listen, for the price point, you likely won’t get better overall earbuds. Seriously.Are these as good as Apple AirPods or the newest Sony earbuds? No, but they’re also 75% cheaper.The good:* Battery life - 6-8 hours (over 24hrs with case)* Soundcore app - lots of customization and built in natural sounds to help you relax, focus, or sleep. Some sounds it offers are wind, rain, thunder, ocean, trains, etc. it very effective and a genius idea.* price point - you won’t find better earbuds at a better price than this. The overall value for what you get is better than ANY other earbuds on the market.* wireless charging case* usb-c charging case* call quality is awesome. Whether you use one in an ear or both, the call quality is loud, clear for both parties involved and effective.* the fit is very good and comes with multiple ear tips for different sizes of ears.The OK:* decent quality noise cancellation - not great* decent quality active listening - better than averageCould be better:* volume - the volume is sufficient, but I really wish it got louder for those gym sessions where you really want to get that extra pump or push to power you through to the end.Final synopsis:* like I said earlier, you will not find a better bang for your buck. Sure, you can get some premium qualities from other brands, but at a premium price. You get pretty darn close to premium qualities from these at a ridiculous value. This is a no brainer to me. Even if buy these as a “backup” for your gym bag, office, whatever in case you forget your go to pair, you won’t regret it.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2024",AEI5P4SI2X7XYWOL5KT3DUAFASIA,1,6,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.26639639639639634,0.532042042042042,Positive
R3BBEJ31ICODZB,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars These buds are part of my life now.,Trucker Frank,5,"I absolutely love these ear buds!Comfort:I've never been a fan of ear buds in general because they've always hurt my ears but these don't. They are very comfortable and I can actually wear them for over an hour without them bothering me.Sound:The sound out of these little things is awesome! Loud, clear and full sound. Great bass which surprised me because I didn't expect it. Nice clear highs that don't sound like tin.Noise Cancelling:I've been using these in very noisy environments and they do extremely well. I work in trucking and my favorite place to use these is in the yard truck at the terminal while moving trailers around. It's an old beat up terminal tractor that just makes a ton of noise and clanks, bangs, shakes, and in general just a loud annoying place to be. These ear buds bring all that noise to a slight hum. With the music at half volume you barely hear the noise at all. Also did an excellent job at keeping things quiet while running the snow blower on my driveway.Transparency Mode:This feature works as expected. Not sure what else to say about it really lol. If I keep the music at a quarter volume I can hold a conversation with people even in a warehouse environment without feeling like I have to shout over the music or guess what they're trying to tell me. They also have a vocal mode in the software which actually makes some voices clearer when the person is at a distance and standing next to a noisy truck.Phone calls:They sound great and the caller can hear me perfectly too! I was blown away by this because going back to the terminal tractor I was talking about in the noise cancelling part of this review it's noisy... But the caller and I can clearly hold a conversation and it sounds great on both sides of the call. On a side note, the call sounds and goes smoothly even with a winter beeny hat over them WHILE DRIVING that insanely noisy truck!Battery life:The battery life has been great for my use case. I don't really wear them for very long in one shot like other people might. But, I've never had them go low on me and I've been on the same charge for the past 3 weeks with using them about 2 to 3 hours a day 5 days out of the week and I pretty much exclusively use noise cancelling or transparency modes. With that in mind when I put them back in the case I still get the 3 lights for state of charge.The Case:THANK YOU ANKER for pretty much having USB-C on everything you guys make and not putting Micro B on the lower cost products! Seriously, I really appreciate that. The case itself is great too. The ear buds snap in nice and easy when putting them away without fumbling. The shape of it feels good in my inside coat pocket which I know is subjective but I can say it's definitely not an annoying thing to carry. The cover is a cover lol. It closes nice, doesn't flop open and doesn't feel flimsy. The 3 lights show battery state of charge and light up for bud engagement confirmation when placing a bud in the case which is nice.Bluetooth:Works fantastic as you'd expect out of a device these days. Paired instantly with my phone on the first try. Doesn't cut out or cause any fuss and it's not laggy.Cons:I really haven't found any. But if I really had to be picky... I wish the volume control was a swipe gesture instead of a tap. It would be nice if they told you battery percentage when you turn the buds on. And I wish I had a case for the case, which may sound silly but a clamshell zipper case would be nice to have just to keep them extra safe. Honestly, I love these things so much that I'd probably cry if anything happened to them lol.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2022",AH3522A3DKI4ERI334G4H5CTXSJA,1,57,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.24830128205128205,0.5549216524216525,Positive
R1RFFM4500JQBQ,B093SLWMS7,3.0 out of 5 stars Good… But not for everyone,Amazon Customer,3,"Don’t get me wrong. These Bluetooth earbuds are really good. But before you let me tell you why I am rating them 3 stars. Let’s start with the pros of these earbuds shall we. Bluetooth (true wireless), water resistant, noise cancellation, good batter life, and the software (app I should say) is perfect for custom controls. Now what are cons, the noise canceling is slightly there, I’m outside working with machinery and the noise bleeds right through (even using the settings in the app to keep for noise canceling outdoor, indoor, and transport) even having the on transport still bleeds in noise. Lightly plug your ears with your fingers and yup you got the full effect. The loudness of these earbuds is non existent. I was using these earbuds while my dad was jamming on the radio. I didn’t even hear my song with the volume all the way up with the highest noise canceling settings. Like I said they are great but not for everyone. If you never had noise canceling headphones or earbuds before. I highly recommend these so you can get started. I’m sure working inside or walking in public these are probably great, but if you are like me using a lawn mower then these are probably not worth your 74 bucks.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2024",AFLLR7467DM5L73ZOSVVOHWEBMQQ,1,0,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.3268154761904762,0.5529960317460317,Positive

Very good for the price, with a couple of minor bugs.",LCB,5,"I wanted earbuds that offered good quality for classical music at a decent price. After checking online reviews I ordered these.Pros:1. Sound: Sound quality is quite well balanced. The app for these buds includes an equalizer that allows you to types of music (jazz, classical, electronic, etc., etc., etc...). The equalizer also has a custom feature that allows you to customize your sound.2. App: The app is very intuitive, and in addition to the equalizer, includes controls for ambient sound (noise cancellation), gaming mode, tip fit test, etc.. It also shows you how to set up the buds right out of the box. and allows you to customize the tap settings, etc. I haven't used it for phone calls, but some reviewers say they work well.3. Charging: You can use a USB cable or a wireless charging pad to charge it.Cons:1. User manual: The included manual is useless. It's printed in tiny light blue font on white (Why? Why? Oh Why?). I downloaded the pdf version of the manual and had to blow it up to read it.The good news is that you can ditch the manual and use the app, which explains everything you need.2. Ear Tips: It includes several size ear-tips, but as other reviewers noted, they don't do a good job of securing the buds. Fortunately I had a set of ""LUDOS Comfy Earbuds Replacement Memory Foam Ear Tips"" (Available on Amazon). These come in several sizes and colors including dayglow (makes finding the buds easier). They work perfectly.3. Noise cancellation: The app allows you to select different cancellation modes. Although noise-cancellation is not perfect, it's good for most environments.Final notes: These are not on a league with $200.00 plus earbuds, but if you are on a budget, you get a lot of bang for the buck at $70.00.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AGNBGS4QA2RI5FO2QNVRNYVHW26A,1,5,Color: Oat White,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.21643772893772897,0.4068223443223443,Positive
R1QYXYTK0TIXIJ,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent warranty and customer service,ImmaDad,5,"About a year with my Life P3 and the left earbud gave up the ghost. Looking back at the last few weeks I think there were signs that I wrote off as little glitches. Things like the mic not working until I reconnected and the audio balance between left and right earbuds being very noticeable.Then last week the left ear just stopped working. I did all the things suggested on the site (cleaning the connections with rubbing alcohol, delete and resetup connection, making sure it’s fully charged, etc etc etc.) but no luck.Poking around the Soundcore site I see that the earbuds are covered under an 18 month warranty so a few hours after filling out their online form I receive the first of 3 emails advising that I do all the things I did already to see if that would get the earbud to work. As annoying as that is, I get they need to make sure customers are putting in the effort.I respond back letting them know I did each of the troubleshooting suggestions but apparently I wasn’t clear enough about the rubbing alcohol cleaning because I received the 2nd of my 3 emails stating I need to make sure the connecting points are cleaned which I responded back more carefully this time, making sure to include keywords so the bots know I did my part. The following day I get the 3rd and final email apologizing for the issue and telling me that I should expect a new pair of replacement buds to come out to me in about a week's time.I took that turnaround time with a grain of salt and assumed I would probably see it in a month since I wasn’t sure where it was coming from and how quickly they would have it in a box.2 days later, I come home and there’s a box at my door. just 2 days and I have my new earbuds. I am so impressed by their turnaround that I’m willing to overlook the robo emails I had to go through before getting to this part.I am really impressed by their customer service and have another reason to want to continue to be an Anker customer.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AEBDM5LJPHTASBUTRXQWS56IB3TQ,1,1,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.1459520803270803,0.4260902677569345,Neutral
RHZIA9ZSQ6PPW,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Value,jdan318,5,"About 2 years ago I bought a pair of these, but recently lost them. I thought of getting a more expensive pair to replace them, but decided these did well enough before. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I am a musician, often mix live sound, and have owned many different pairs of decent open-backed and IEM headphones over the years, so I have some experience with sound quality.The sound quality on this new pair seems near identical to the old ones, which is good for music and videos, but both the battery and noise cancelation is noticeably improved on this newer pair. I would have been happy with an identical product, but the improvements make me very glad I didn't spend money on more expensive wireless earbuds, as these are more than decent, they are good, and for the money I dare say they are great.Update: Went on my first flight, so can give a more comprehensive review on the noise canceling. For cars I've been a passenger in, it eliminates road noise to the point I can't hear it. For a 737 when I'm in a window seat right behind the engine, it eliminates a lot of noise, but it certainly is still there. Still, turning it off then on again showcased that it still was bringing it down a ton, but these are not complete elimination (like I've read the Bose are).Still, while these are great at eliminating road, engine, and wind noise, what they do almost nothing for is voices. They do fit flush in my ear and create a seal, which does an okay job of bringing down talking and crying, but I still clearly heard babies crying during the flights. In the airport terminal, the indoor mode did lower the din of many people talking, but anything remotely close where you could listen to what they are saying still comes through. It does something, and for the price still is fine, but don't expect anything close to silence when surrounded by people talking.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AEI62QY4IKCSR6XXPL3GY5ZONRYA,1,1,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.21952861952861952,0.5151145151145151,Positive
R3A0KLJPHZU01B,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars So happy with these!,Dan,5,"I have a Samsung Galaxy A14 and bought thr Galaxy Pro 2 earbuds for $115, but no matter what I did, I couldn't bring out mid- and high-frequency in the mix, it was dominated by bass. I ordered these for around $65 and was so glad to see I could custom equalize them and save my custom EQ's (need to have a Soundcore login). They sound great and I can clearly hear the detail in the mids and highs. Just got them, so don't know yet about battery life, ANR, etc., but I got them for the sound.I had a lot of trouble pairing them, but it turns out Bluetooth was trying to recognize my old pair of Anker Soundcore earbuds, which showed up on my Bluetooth scan, and getting confused. I went to Bluetooth settings and ""forgot"" the older earbuds, rebooted everything including the phone, earbuds, Bluetooth, and Soundcore app, and the new earbuds showed up on my Bluetooth scan and I was able to connect easily.

R1ZUV9LN8IXENV,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Had to get something to replace my AirPods!,Amazon Customer,5,"I just received these today and I’m already impressed! I got them marked down to $55 (they were 13% off and there was a 20% coupon available as well).Before getting these, I was using AirPod Pros but they ended up getting water damage and I would need to pay near full price to get them replaced (original price $250). Unfortunately that wasn’t really in the budget, so I started looking for alternatives.First, sound quality is pretty great! There’s an app where you can adjust the sound settings as well. They have a noise cancelling, transparency, and normal mode just like AirPods do, and there’s an equalizer available if you’re someone who likes to adjust things more specifically to your tastes.Second, they pair to my phone pretty easily. I was worried the process would feel clunky since AirPods connect with no effort to Apple products, but once you pair them initially, they connect seamlessly.They fit really well due to the four silicone ear piece size options. I have small ears and the XS tips fit perfectly.Overall super happy with these!

R25Y31E25PM4WU,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars (EDIT) Left earbud isn’t working with ANC or ambient noise modes,McScruff8188,4,"Edit:After purchasing a different pair a few months after this incident it was a completely different experience and for the extortionately low cost of the Anker Soundcore life P3, along with the five shades of beautiful eye catching colors (my personal favorite was the coral red, however the baby blue variant is absolutely stunning as well! I’m now using the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 in a dark cherry red color which I find sexy and if we were to compare the two versions, of course we’d know which would come out on top due to the numerous different flagship level features but if you’re on a budget and are looking for another brand in this particular price range, I highly recommend you stop and pick up a pair of these. They have everything you could want in a nice pair of earbuds. I don’t really use the ANC modes on any of my earbuds unless it’s by accident but I can assure you that the ambient sound mode is top tier, the sound profile is dang near flawless and the app has a host of other different equalizer presets and you can also use the EQ settings to adjust the sound to your own liking. I’m a huge Apple fanboy and though I do love the AirPods Pro 2, I think that Anker has them beat in a few different areas, especially with my latest earbuds. My three favorite bands are Anker, Sony linkbuds S, and though I have yet to test them out, I’m trying to make it a goal to get a pair of the Technics MAH-AZ60M2 in the flashy blue color. But I will never, even if I were rich, be able to justify a $250 price tag on a pair of earbuds that you can get similar results with a $115 or less on the Anker Soundcore earbuds. It doesn’t matter what model you purchase, they have all different kinds that suit each individual. I am going through some of my older, lazily made reviews and am going to update them with a long term follow-up on most of the items, especially if I have found pictures of the ones that I failed to provide at the time of my initial review and will change my opinion and recommendations accordingly to make sure that everyone is given an unbiased view and opinion that will help you better understand the products you might want to purchase. But I would definitely recommend these earbuds and I actually wish I would’ve gotten a pair for an emergency in case the ones I’m using go out on me. That’s dreaming big right now since I can’t even afford my cellular bill nor my rent. Of course nobody is willing to help me with my current situation and expects me to pull money out of my a$& and drive to the next city over to the UPS store where I get rejected by this very mean and rude old lady who apparently hates her job and everyone else too. Also this has nothing to do with this product review but I would be very cautious about dealing with UPS. I have lost a lot of money and items via their “premium services” and even just simple returns have never been heard from in months. They encourage you to take the items to your local Kohl’s (which is literally a mile down the road from where I live and could easily walk there) but it seems that the more I have a very serious problem that needs addressing right then, they go out of their way to be the worst human beings they can. I’ve been stuck in a customer service chat for literally over 13 hours before, on more than one occasion where I was transferred to a different representative every few minutes and that caused me to not make it to my Kohl’s before they closed last night so I just stopped the chat because I am clogging my phone with screenshots of not so good behavior and practices. But I just can’t stand the fact that you have people who abuse the system every day and I actually do the right thing and actually interact with the company to seek help and I feel like I am getting the middle finger every time. Not from you Anker you’re awesome! I’m just speaking out loud. I hope everyone and their families enjoy and have a safe rest of your weekend!(Original review)I have attempted every troubleshooting technique there is and for some reason the left earbud will not adapt to the ANC and ambient noise modes after a week and a half.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2023",AF2RGROS4CEWHORYVTQS6HTF64EQ,1,0,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.14238388105323593,0.48674709848096953,Neutral

RGE218DGT8WNG,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Calls; Lacking 2 Features,silverado98_nighthawk84,4,"This is now my third pair of earbuds. Comparing this to my previous ones (Earfun Air Pro 3, Earfun Air Pro), these Soundcore Life P3 knock it out of the park when it comes to background noise isolation in calls. Absolute night and day difference. I did a test in a noisy room (fan/air noise from a large HVAC unit) and these were so much clearer. The background noise was almost non-existent. I bought these primarily based on reviews of excellent call quality, and so far that has been true. I'll be testing more with phone calls as time goes on. As far as sound goes when listening to music, the quality seems top-notch, especially for the price point (I was able to snag these on sale). Personal preference, but I like the Soundcore Signature equalizer setting. It also has a BassUp option that I like as well. Upon opening the case, they pair very quickly with my phone.So far, my only dislikes/gripes with these are: 1) lack of ear/proximity detection and 2) lack of multi-device (multipoint) connection. With today's bluetooth technology, I don't understand why the multi-device connection is missing. My Earfun Air Pro has it and I didn't pay any more for them than I did these. (Earfun Air Pro 3 also lack this feature.) I can and will live without the ear detection, but having to constantly disconnect and reconnect between my phone and computer is going to be an annoyance more than anything. Had these Soundcore Life P3 included this, I would have given them five stars, even without the ear detection.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2024",AFILWMLMEEVRAD4OAQJ2T6XSBIFA,1,0,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.26113816738816736,0.5918154761904764,Positive

They don’t disconnect as easy as the other brands I’ve had, which can be annoying when you need to take them out for a sec. I love that it has an app that comes with it to let you do your own setting for each ear. Literally took less than one min to connect to my device and set up the app.I literally don’t have any complaints. I don’t use them everyday so standby time was important for me and literally weeks went by before I had to charge my headphones. If you use them a lot of course don’t expect the battery to last that long. But still the battery life is pretty good on these. Love the different size buds it comes with, I have small ears and always have a hard time with headphones but not theses d they don’t slide out of my ears either.

R1EH3QXWY5FLQC,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Would and Have Recommended,Taylar Karnes,4,"I work in a university lab space where I use these headphones for about 50 hours every single week. I'm also very clumsy, resulting in these headphones experiencing many hip-height drops to concrete floors. Despite this, they have lasted me much longer than any other earbud has to date at 20 months of constant use and abuse - and they are only giving out in the sense that the dwindled battery life (expected of rechargeable batteries vs. replaceable batteries) is becoming a nuisance when I can't constantly switch them in the lab. Good sound quality and noise canceling with customizing available through the manufactures app. Until recently, I have been getting 8-9 hours of battery life per earbud and only changing the case once per week. I have occasionally struggled with bluetooth connectivity not recognizing the device, though I suspect this is linked to drops and repairing the device solves the problem quickly. Fit of the in ear buds is good, though not perfect and occasionally require adjusting or result in slipping.Ultimately, I would and have recommended these to coworkers and friends, and will be buying a new pair to refresh battery longevity for personal convenience.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AHDJAENYQDKRYRMNDEDFMANLQB6A,1,0,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.12391022021456802,0.4643694711086016,Neutral
RB5NJ0AUTC858,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing bass and great ANC,Andrew,5,"It’s amazing how much quality and great features you’re getting at this price point. I honestly didn’t know what to expect, since I’m used to buying much more expensive gear, so I wasn’t expecting much. I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised! They sound GREAT, extra, full range, deep bass, but the rest of the frequency range sounds good. Definitely not muddy or overbearing, I listened to rock as well as bass heavy electronic tracks and all sounded great.Comfort:Comfort for me is the #1 thing when it comes to earbuds or headphones. It doesn’t matter how good they sound or how good the ANC or features are if they’re not comfortable! These fit the bill nicely. I had never worn stem style earbuds before, but it doesn’t really make a noticeable difference to your comfort anyway, you can’t feel the stem. These are light and don’t apply pressure to any area on my ear that would otherwise lead to discomfort (like most of the other earbuds in the market that are unnecessarily large, like the new Sony WF-1000XM4). I can wear these for hours with no discomfort whatsoever, so we got a winner here.ANC: The ANC on these is a bit different than what I’m used to, as I’ve never owned earbuds with ANC, just cans like my beloved Bose QC35’s and my JBL Tour One, of which the Bose obviously is the king. Well, when compared to my Bose, these Life P3’s do a pretty good job of muffling the heavy, industrial fan I have in my room, and in some cases blocking out different frequencies better than the Bose. The fan just sounds different. Maybe it's not as quiet as with the Bose but the pitch it gets on these is very subdued. (I have a VERY loud fan in my room on purpose so as to have a very loud white noise that I can sleep to while drowning out the rest of the outside noises that wake me otherwise). The thing about the ANC on these earbuds is that it has 3 modes, transit, indoor and outdoor. I found indoor to be the best for me personally around the house, it brought a very impressive level of attenuation. I could still clearly hear my dogs barking but all the other, more constant noises went VERY silent. In some cases it feels more silent than the Bose cans do, and those are among the best ANC performers on the market. Don’t get me wrong, the Bose are still kings in that regard, but it does by no means put these buds to shame, they stand up surprisingly well. I wish there was an option for selecting “maximum” ANC where it would mix the 3 options, because while standing next to my fan, I went through all 3 and they each blocked a different frequency range from the fan and changed its pitch and perceived loudness. I’m sure they’re capable of consolidating all 3 and bringing even more impressive ANC but I suspect they don’t do this in order to not hurt their flagship. Just my guess but regardless, the ANC performance in these buds is nothing to scoff at and I am actually very happy with and impressed by them in that regard. Transparency mode on these is also very good, you don’t have to take your buds out in order to have a conversation or be aware of your surroundings. I have mine set to long press to switch between ANC on and Ambient aware on. Which brings me to the next plus, the touch controls on these earbuds is actually decent, unlike my JBL Tour One where adjusting my headset often times results in activating the touch controls unintentionally. That doesn’t happen with these buds.Find my buds:This has a feature where it makes your buds make a loud noise so you can find them. Pretty neat if you ask me, I’m thinking of getting a pair of these for my mother, since she’s constantly losing everything.In conclusion:I’m very happy with my purchase, I have included many pictures so you can see what you get when you buy these and what it all looks like. I would definitely recommend these to anyone, for the money, they can’t be beat and even if they were more expensive, I’m sure most would be happy with them.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2021",AHHTZ2TA4U5S7CZCQPODGDD6VVMQ,1,53,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.29050983153392795,0.5538662007336707,Positive

The earbuds themselves fit my small ears quite nicely, and it comes with a set of different sizes of ear piece (S to XL). I like that you can change the noise cancellation settings and customize the EQ. It also has a ton of EQ presets tailored for different types of music (haven’t tried them out yet but seems pretty extensive).My favorite part is that you can customize the touch settings (see last photo)!! I actually didn’t realize you could when I bought them, didn’t know about the feature until I set them up. Each earbud can have different settings, too.I’ve always hated the touch play/pause feature on my other earbuds because when I need to brush my hair behind my ear and accidentally brush the button and it pauses my music, and can’t wear earbuds under winter hats because the movement of the fabric makes it play/pause. Now, I am able to turn off all single-touch functions, and instead have the long touch as play/pause.These also have a great Bluetooth range. I like to have my earbuds connected to my laptop and “watch” Netflix while I’m cleaning the house, and I can leave my laptop in the kitchen while walking all over the house (several floors in a funky split-level), including into the garage and out to the dumpster, without the sound cutting out.

R30TEMP5P2P704,B093SLWMS7,"2.0 out of 5 stars Used to recommend, Now I don't :(",Zak Awry,2,"UPDATE 09/02/21: Although I do still love them I can't recommend them anymore for the following reasons:1. I've found issues with disconnecting them from my phones bluetooth then trying to reconnect them to my computer bluetooth it just tells me it can't connect to the P3's. It's a MAJOR pain to disconnect them from your phone, put them back in their case and close it, open it back up and take them out and disconnect them again from my phone when they automatically reconnect to the last device and finally be able to connect to my computer. I don't know if that's the norm? Or if it's something I'm doing but that's been my experience trying to switch between two devices. Not always, but frequently enough to be a problem.2. Along the lines with connectivity issues, I've also had recent problems where they were connected to my phone and I put them in their case for a length of time (anywhere from 15 mins to an hour) and I grab them out of the case walking out the door to start walking expecting that they'll automatically connected like usual but for some reason they don't/wont reconnect for seemingly no reason. The first time it happened I chalked it up to user error but after a 3rd or 4th time I'm starting to suspect it's product. It's easy to reset them with the case but I don't take the case on walks with me so can be SUPER annoying and unusable for the duration of your walk/activity.3. Today after resetting the head phones I connected them to my computer to listen to music while my phone did a system update. I've frequently had it connected to my computer in the past for Zoom calls and listening to music and videos, etc. Normally when connected to the computer I have the same sound quality I do when connected to my phone, however, today for the first time, after connecting it to my computer the sound quality was TERRIBLE. And I don't mean just kind of bad I mean it sounds like a low quality tape recording from the radio coming out of a blown phone speaker in a bowl (When using a streaming service like Spotify or YouTube). I'm SUPER disappointed in them. I don't know if they did an update that f-ed them all up or what but yikes. Due to the recent issue's I've experienced I've reduced my original 5 star rating down to a 2 star. :( Hopefully their next headphone release will be way better. Maybe the Liberty Air Pro 2's are better?I'm new to the Soundcore Brand but after paying $40 dollars for one of there older earbuds and being blown away I figured I'd pay a little more and try a higher quality ear bud from them and....just wow. These are far better than I was expecting. I might be a little easier satisfied than someone who classifies themselves as an 'audiophile' or someone who needs head phones for music production reasons and although the noise cancelling isn't quite as good as my over the ear Sony WH-1000XM4 but the Life P3's are $270 LESS and they're actually pretty darn close. The P3's have a great fit for your ears, I can do yoga while wearing them and they don't fall out. The App is a very nice touch. Nothing worse than trying to figure out what you're doing pushing and holding buttons like on the Life A1's but not knowing what equalizer you're on. Incredible sound and base and they get SUPER LOUD.Pros:~The App - Gives you a battery life indicator for each head phone, Gives you access to Ambient Sound, Gaming Mode, Equalizer, Controls, Superior sleep sounds, and Tip Fit Test * Gives you 3 ambient sound options Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and normal mode. 3 options for noise cancellation - transport, indoor, and outdoor. * Gaming mode - you can turn on to reduce the latency while gaming or watching videos. * Equalizer - gives you the option to custom tune your earbuds or using one of their 21 preset ones. * Controls - lets you customize the touch response on the ear buds to do the controls that you want the most. * Superior Sleep gives you access to 11 ambient sounds to help you fall asleep (although, you're a champion if you can fall asleep with these or any other ear buds in.) * Tip Fit Test - Tests the Tip seal on the head phones to make sure you're getting the most out of your ear buds.~ Tip Selection - Like all of Soundcore ear buds a huge selection of ear tip pieces so you can get a comfortable fit.~ Wireless charging case~ Noise Cancellation - is it the best? Probably not. Will it block out a lot of the noise? Absolutely. I used to have to close my office door every day at work when coworkers would start talking, now my doors wide open and I can't hear any of them.~ Comfort - I was worried that with my ears and everything that they might stick out too far but they sit comfortably inside of my ear and don't stick out far at all. Looks like I have Air pods in.~ So many color options.Cons: There aren't many that I can find.~ No bluetooth Multipoint (Being able to connect to more than one bluetooth at a time.) This is the biggest con for me. (Don't believe any of the Soundcore ear buds have this yet, but may be wrong.)~ No in ear detection when you remove an ear bud to pause music.~ No HearID in the app - I believe that's because that's a Liberty series feature, so I guess it makes sense it's not included.If you're trying to decide between the Liberty Air 2 Pro or the Life P3's I can't see much of a difference between them other than the HearID test. If you have extra money to burn or the HearID is a super important feature you want, I'd honestly stick with the Life P3's and save $50 bucks.I'm hoping on Soundcores next ear bud release will include the in ear detection as well as the multipoint bluetooth connection (Hopefully on the liberty series so I can try the HearID as well).","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2021",AHDPUWA75ZO5ENF3Q2NZ7KFOHIBA,1,123,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.17010611433483777,0.5495459918332255,Neutral

The connectivity is really good, I haven't had problems yet. The problems I have with it are honestly just personal preference, so if you're not like me, then these are good for you.Pros:1) Amazing audio quality2) Affordable price3) Highly customizable4) Bluetooth range is extremely high5) The case isn't too bulky, but also isn't too small, so I know when it is and isn't in my pocket.6) Earbuds fit very nicely in my ears7) The battery life is AMAZING. I've been using these for 3 days on a single charge and they haven't died yet. Keep in mind I use earbuds for at least 5-7 hours a day.Cons:1) Case durability is bad. 1st day out of the box and I already had scratches just from it being alone in my pocket. If you're gonna get the earbuds, get a travel case for them.2) The vocal transparency mode (the one that lets you have conversations while playing music) doesn't let you actually have an understandable conversation without the volume being at 50% and/or being right up next to the person.3) This one's just personal preference, but the bass isn't punchy at all. You can turn on a setting in the app for more punchy bass, but it still doesn't feel like enough.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AHONEA7UI7436IZJVLYWCS7ECVRA,1,1,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.16580357142857152,0.5065277777777778,Neutral

It is so very frustrating to be listening to a book, try to pause it, and be unable to get it paused.

R3LM0FUS1XHSRB,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Updated to 4 Stars Based on Customer Service/Fixes for several issues,James,4,"Leaving my original review below but changing my review to 4 stars based on the customer service. I reached out to Anker about my issues below and their CSR was very responsive. She walked me through a number of steps and when resets, etc. did not fix the connection problems, she gave me a RMA and shipped me a new unit as well as some foam eartips. The foam tips did WONDERS. I am surprised that they do not include them as an option in the box from the get go (maybe people like me are a very small minority) but they worked really well in keeping the buds in place. They will still come out in extended use (still waiting on a spirit x version of these) but I definitely don't have the same fear that they will fall out at an inopportune time. I still have a few connection issues from time to time and the lack of physical buttons can often be rage inducing so I'm not giving these 5 stars but they are a really good value for the money and from a company that stands behind their product.Original review below:Anker has provided so much value to me over the years (to date, I've bought the soundcore life 2, life q20, spirit X, curve, and an untold amount of cables :D) and I want to love these earbuds so much. There's so much promise and so many features but the sum of it all falls short for me.First off, they look great - as soon as I bought them (my first set of wireless earbuds), people in my office were asking what they were because they looked really sharp. When I am sitting down at my desk and have both of these in, they are really good at blocking out exterior noise which is why I bought them (I work in a refashioned warehouse and the HVAC system and the industrial refrigerators we have create a ton of looping, irritating noise). The ANC is pretty solid for my needs and the sound quality for the podcasts I listen to seems really good.However, the problems arise when I am not using them in that ideal scenario (seated, both buds in). When I have one bud in, the touch controls don't seem to work as well and I have to try a few times for the command to register, if it does at all. This might be a minor quibble as I'm not sure how many people are going into ""mono"" mode but since it is most of my day, it can make the headphones borderline unusable for me. In the same vein, I do like the app (Android) but I hate the widget - whenever I flip to it to switch the hearing modes, it never says the buds are connected...even though they are in my ear and playing music. It defeats the purpose of using a widget because I then have to unlock my phone and do it through the app. Now, I wouldn't have to do it through the app ... if the touch controls worked properly when I had one bud in. It's a cycle of frustration!Finally, the biggest problem for me is that the buds simply do not stay in all the time. especially when I am walking. I have tried several of the covers that they provided in the box and while I get a good seal for listening, I can feel the bud start to slip out of my ear as I am walking. I start panicking that it's going to fall and slam on the stamped concrete floors of the office and I'm going to be out the money I paid for these. If Anker made a spirit X version of these that hooked above the ear, that might be a better choice for me. For now, because of the above frustrations, these have been relegated to just at home use for my wife and I when we are not being active and can have both buds in.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2021",AHUK67NI4JQRYVD3RJ6YLQEOC47Q,1,104,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.15154201590371805,0.4550139694820548,Neutral
RJCLBUNTY2E0X,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressive buds for the price,H. Fox,5,"I'm nothing close to being an audiophile, but I use earbuds and headphones of several different brands a lot, in and out of the house. As a 65+ senior with a mild but annoying tinnitus problem, I use my AirPods Pro every time I watch TV at home because, without them, it's very difficult to catch all of the dialogue of almost every program I watch. They sync with my LG TV very well so I don't have to adjust TV settings for video/audio syncing.But this is a review of the Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds, so why am I talking up the AirPods Pro? Simple. They make for a great comparison. I've owned earlier versions of the Anker Soundcore non-ANC buds that were less expensive, and it showed in their performance. But, I gotta say, the P3 ANCs are way, way better. I don't fly a lot, but recently, on some very long flights from Florida to western Canada, the P3s really shined. The constant noise level in most airliners is terrible and completely wears me out even after short flights. I was skeptical about using earbuds instead of headphones, but I literally couldn't believe my ears when I popped the P3s in and was instantly transformed by the quiet! Their noise canceling performance might not be the very best, but I've tried other brands including Sony, Sennheiser and Bowers-Wilkins and the P3s are truly nearly as good - including my AirPods Pro, which are my all-time favorites for both overall sound quality and ANC. The shocker, of course, is that the P3s are a fraction of the cost.To my problematic ears the sound quality of the P3s isn't quite there, but they are way more than just satisfactory. I would have given them four-and-a-half stars for that aspect, but Amazon won't let me. All around, the P3s are just plain awesome, and at their price point, they're amazing. Oh, and by the way, they work very well with my LG TV also. If I couldn't, or didn't want to, afford the AirPods Pro, the P3s would make me very happy as an alternative.Now for one quibble. The P3s charging case is just plain terrible. Not because they don't protect the buds or charge them properly, but because, in my experience, they're constantly popping open and dropping the P3s at the worst possible moments. The case is SO easy to accidently pop open, that if dropped a mere few inches onto a firm surface, mine would flop open and invariably the earbuds would just fall out. This made for some especially exciting moments on said airline trip to Canada. I nearly lost the P3s several times when they'd fall out of a pocket, or my backpack, and the case would pop open and scatter the buds in different directions. Just try finding two black earbuds on black carpet under your airline seat a couple times - not a pleasant experience. Heads up, Anker! I love a lot of your products, but you could do seriously better designing a case for such great earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2023",AEKYMROIZQIL46DMG3NJLQI6B6MQ,1,32,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.06838325652841783,0.5178456221198157,Neutral

R1F4CL31ULDQW1,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great for price, very strong bass (maybe too strong)",eqrweqe,4,"I revisited these after my Sony WF-1000XM4's started experiencing battery issues and the company wouldn't replace them.Putting them in is still a trick I'm learning to master. I still don't quite get the ""lock"" movement, but once they're in they stay in about as well as any other bud.For the price, the sound quality is essentially the same as the XM4's. Both earbuds needed some fussing with the EQ to get the best profile. The major difference is that while Sony lets you control the bass boost, this one goes full throttle. I had to heavily boost all the other frequencies in the EQ while reducing the lower frequencies to near zero (see screenshot for my recommendation) just to get it to a level I would consider acceptable. Some will like how ungodly strong it is, others will not.Noise canceling seems to be about on par with Sony, but the ambient sound is definitely much worse. The XM4's were clear as day whereas these still sound quite muffled. But the XM4's are a few bennies whereas this is 60 bucks, so you can't really complain too much.Touch controls are responsive, though you might get some accidental presses here and there. The only thing I wish these had was a sensor to automatically pause when you take the earbuds out, but I think I'll live.Bottom line, for 60 bucks these are really good earbuds that can compete with the best, with a few caveats here and there.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2024",AG7A23DX5XH3NCQ3THOP3P2LEO5A,1,0,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.17026515151515154,0.41553030303030297,Neutral

RFD4WZ3MS8Y2O,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Good value for price - with a catch,StephenH,4,"Briefly, I find these earbuds well worth the price and recommend them. My review is not a comparison of the product to others but the value of my purchase. * Noise cancellation is so-so overall. It's not ""true"" noise cancellation but rather smooths out ambient sounds. For example, the outdoor setting is reasonable for reducing wind noise but does not eliminate it. However, I do not find stark differences between the settings. The app has been updated since my purchase a couple months ago, and my initial experience with noise reduction was better before the update(s). Users can hope for Anker to do more tweaking to improve this feature.* Fit and finish is good. The case seems sturdy and would probably easily withstand a few drops. I like the tip selection and customizing them did improve my experience, although not as dramatically as perhaps advertised. I have slept with these earbuds with no negative consequence. The tap response is satisfactory although requiring something of a firm touch - some users may appreciate this while others might prefer a lighter touch.* The app is easy to navigate and the preset equalizer settings are numerous. The various settings are unique and have a qualitative impact on sound. This is not a situation where the user changes a setting and struggles to hear the difference. I have had no problem with the buds synching with my device or with each other (e.g., one earbud works but the other does not).* Sound quality is good and provides a good range of tones. I am a bit skeptical of the ""big bass,"" but again the setting does have an impact on sound. An audiophile should probably look elsewhere but sound quality will well satisfy most users.* The range - the distance between my device and the earbuds - is good. I am fortunate to live in a larger than average home and do not lose connection unless I am on the opposite end of the house from my device.* I have not used the wireless charging but have no reason to doubt the function. Otherwise, the battery appears to have a long-life; I have yet to experience running out of charge either with the earbuds themselves or with the case. I typically use these a few hours a day and charge the case every few weeks.* I reserve my opinion about using these earbuds on a phone call because I haven't taken a call. However, I have noticed that when my phone rings, the ringtone sounds tinny. This doesn't bode well for calls, although voices - such as audiobooks and podcasts - have a good sound.After two months of use, I recommend these earbuds and would likely buy them again (e.g., should I lose this pair). However, I paid $20 less than the current list price - a $60 purchase - and found it a very good deal. At $80, a consumer might shop a little more and possibly consider their device (Apple v. Android) and preference for better noise cancellation. Nonetheless, the average listener will be satisfied with the purchase even at the higher price point.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2022",AGIDTSAC6QLWO5LSJBIZ5CYRG6IA,1,3,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.16211692395654656,0.4744654088050314,Neutral
R1H9WQM7P0JUI,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Incredible base, great noise cancellation, needs mute function",Scoobi_FreeBSD,4,"These are my 1st attempt at using an ear bud-style audio device since trying the wired bluetooth kind probably 5 years ago; those had an ear hook wrapped around my ear to hold them in. Other ear buds I've tried would not stay in my ears, so I've been using over-the-ear headphones.These ear buds fit my ears pretty well; the initial rubber cups that go into the ear seemed to fit pretty well; I tried 1 size up and 1 size down, actually went with 1 size up on the left ear. The buds work themselves out of my ears when I'm chewing (not sure if that's a common problem), but otherwise they stay in place fairly well when sitting at my desk (haven't tried them at the gym yet...guess I'll have to start going again).I read the reviews on the great bass response of these buds, they're all true! I was amazed at how realistic the bass was when listening to TV shows (e.g. the scene transition sound in The Big Bang Theory). Noise cancellation is also excellent; when I turn on noise cancellation with the TV on, it's almost like someone hit the mute button (of course it's not perfect and I can still hear the TV). Noise cancellation can be customized using the downloadable mobile app to cancel specific frequencies, or to pass through voice frequencies. Battery life is excellent, lasting at least 5 hours before the buds notify me with ""battery low"" every 5 minutes. One bud will konk out first and the other one several minutes later. I can use the buds with a fully-charged case for several days on a single case charge, using them a few (~2-4) hours per day. Microphones are good quality; I have not had any complaints from people I've been on calls with.The buds are controlled via capacitive touch actions on the main outer body of each bud. There are 3 actions one can perform on each bud - single tap, double tap and long press. Each action can be mapped to one of a number of actions - volume up, volume down, cycle through noise cancellation modes, initiate voice assistant (e.g. Alexa or Google Home), next track, previous track, play/pause. Single tap cannot do voice assistant, as of firmware version 02.61.The case is small, about the size of a plum. I've dropped the case with the ear buds in it a couple times, no noticeable damage, but the ear buds will fly everywhere.My only complaint is with the app and a missing ""mute"" function which can silence all audio from a paired Bluetooth device so I can hear what someone is saying. The app is reasonably user-friendly, and you essentially need it to change noise cancellation mode between all of the available modes (there's 6). Tap actions can only move you between the 3 categories - normal (off), transparency (allow certain frequencies) and noise cancellation. It would be nice if they added a mute/unmute tap action which turns off the audio I'm listening to.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2021",AFJPI2IAJX2PMC2LL4NMSH5DCX5Q,1,2,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.1139132553606238,0.42671261487050965,Neutral

R2ZXJST4ARM093,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Deal for The Money.,Woody D.,4,"I am a former live sound engineer. To me sound quality is the number one concern. My last two sets of buds were actually sold as in ear monitors for professional musicians. One set were wired Sony's and the other Advanced AD3 wireless with a wire between the buds. Both had excellent sound quality. Since I have not had individual buds before and was afraid of losing one, I decided not to break the bank with my first pair. High end buds go for north of $200. I bought the P3s after doing quite a bit of research.When they arrived they were pretty easy to set up. The app you use with them is pretty simple. It includes a customizable EQ so you can tailor the sound to your liking. I use a ""dog eared"" setting boosting the bass and treble while leaving the midrange flat. The sound is really quite good.I would call the noise cancelling decent but not great. Of course in my opinion the only way you get great cancelling is with full headphones. You have a choice of different NC settings. I find the ""indoor"" setting works the best at the gym to somewhat drown out the music they are playing. I have not tried them on an airplane yet. As I mentioned I was afraid of losing a bud....so much that I leave them in until I get home and dump them in the charging case. When I leave the gym I just switch to the ""Ambient"" sound mode and I can hear the world around me pretty well. The buds work very well for phone calls. My wife says my voice sounds perfect when she calls.The controls on the buds for changing volume or tracks work ok, but are not perfect. At time I find myself just reaching for my phone to change track or adjust volume. That may be more about my gnarly fingers than the buds.I am still trying to get the pairing routine worked out. I have them paired with my phone, tablet and Peloton. I know they are supposed to pair automatically to the primary device, but I find I need to put them into pairing mode most of the time. Once paired they are rock solid....solid as in I left my phone on a machine at the gym, went to the other side of the building and they still worked.The buds fit well in my ears. I don't run, but a sweaty in the saddle, out of the saddle Peloton HIIT ride does not pop them out.The battery life seems good, but honestly I do not wear them more than a couple of hours and the rest of the time they live in their charging case.I would recommend these buds for people who want a pair of bud with good sound and don't want to break the bank to get it. They also look pretty cool.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2022",AHDJQTFFOXZTJHMCDQMXVBWB632Q,1,6,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.22750428816466553,0.5334366576819406,Positive
R1445LYQM6ZZRP,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Quality and Comfort for Under $100,E. J.,4,"EDIT: 7/31/21. I really want to love these earbuds, but the audio keeps cutting out consistently when I use them. I’ve unpaired them from my phone several times, and deleted the device from my phone with no improvement. I still enjoy these earbuds, but I assume they are a faulty set.*Original Review*I’ve used these earbuds for almost 2 weeks and here’s my thoughts:1: Great value for the price.I preordered my pair and got a early bird discount code in my email for 20% off the day they launched. I paid around $65 when I purchased them, tax included.2: Very comfortable.These earbuds have a similar fit to AirPods Pro in the way they nestle on the outer edge of the ear canal. I wear the largest size ear tips and they fit securely. They don’t “plug” your ears, but there’s a slight suction to keep them secure with minimal pressure.3: Sound quality is top tier under $100. Compared to AirPods Pro, there’s richer bass and clarity in my opinion. I achieved this by fiddling with the EQ on the Soundcore app. The default settings are fine, but the sound profile is much more nuanced and not as compressed when you customize it for your taste. I set mine to the R&B preset and customized it.4: Excellent battery life.On my days off I always have my earbuds in listening to YouTube, Apple Music, etc., and they exceeded my expectations. I only had to recharge once every 2-3 days in the time I’ve had them. The case is fairly quick to charge and the earbuds themselves recharge fast after using them throughout the day.5: Noise cancellation is decent.The noise cancellation is detectable and can be very useful in certain environments, but don’t expect complete silence while using it. The different modes are useful, but I prefer to use the indoor mode the most. I estimate about a 50-60% noise reduction when I listen to my fridge running while using the noise cancellation.6: Instant pairing.When I get ready to use the earbuds, they pair with my phone before I get to put them in my ears. The pairing and connection range is very strong and consistent.I have some small criticisms too, starting with the audio playback.1: Audio can randomly go mute while playing media for 1-2 seconds at random times throughout the day. It happens maybe 3-5 times a day and isn’t intrusive, but can get annoying while you watch videos. I understand this is a new product and hopefully this will get fixed with firmware updates.2: Touch controls can be finicky (operator error)There’s a little learning curve to double tap consistently so the earbuds can recognize it. You have to tap near the very top of the earbud stem or it won’t work. It puts pressure into your ear when you tap and the video or music may not recognize it every time.All things considered, these earbuds are a great choice for anyone balling on a budget that wants quality and comfort for under $100.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2021",AEYPDC22S7GYSMNQB4PTDUYOZYOQ,1,3,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.18469012280236763,0.464543687604912,Neutral
R3NDNCKLZM1KJA,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Great pair of PC headsets.,jesus,4,"So I did try to return these. Overall the sound quality is amazing and the sound isolation is not bad. While I'm used to airpods pro 2 and airpods max type of isolation. These are not bad.I mainly bought this as a replacement for my airpods pro 1 generations. As I lost them and find my was not picking up an active trace. I also use both android and iPhone so I wanted a device that essentially runs on both platforms.The case is good with strong magents to hold the ear pieces in. Good sound quality that I think most will enjoy and the features are not too bad.The only issue I had is when I was using them on my phone there was a type of glitch where sound just goes to 100% and I have to click the volume to go back to where it was. What I Mean by this is that let's say I'm watching a video or listen to music at 30% volume. Out of nowhere the audio sounds like it went to 100% which in turn hurts my ears. I then scramble to lower the volume but with one click it goes back to normal. So it wasn't really cranked up to 100% but audio did do that.With this in mind I was in the process with Amazon to return it but while I couldn't return them at the time I figured I'll hold on to them. I went and connected them to my PC and they auto connect and pair and audio plays beautifully. No hickups whatsoever. I think audio though I get more bass and voices like on a discord call while in gameplay is more closer and clear. So like fps games more roomy and bassy but the voice is contrast with clear and close. But overall they are great for PC use. I disabled the touch controls so they are a standalone Bluetooth earpiece that works seamlessly. Once you have put in the other ear in, you are already getting sound from the PC. This is great as while my overhear headsets charge, I use these and audio switches on there own.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2023",AFJZZ7GBHNX4QGHEIDLIXCPSXM5A,1,4,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.2459490740740741,0.4809027777777778,Positive

ROCD5G6VV78AY,B093SLWMS7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Works, but not great.",Anon,3,"I got this because the price was okay and it's recommended as a cheap option for audiophiles. It's an okay product, but I really dislike that it doesn't have physical buttons to press when you want to start/pause something. I disabled the touch sense stuff through the app that it works with, and it seems to ignore the settings I have input. It will still start/pause stuff sometimes, even though the buttons are tied to anything. It also tries to launch ""bixby"", the mobile assistant thing for Samsung. I don't want to use it - I wish it would stop trying to start on its own.They also don't fit particularly well in the ear. They are okay enough that I can run with them in, but I do have to shove them back in, occasionally because it doesn't have a perfect seal around my ear, which causes them to start slipping after a while.

There is I believe a misconception about the difference between noise canceling and noise reducing. If you are mowing or using a blower etc. you need noise REDUCING. Noise cancelling is an artificial noise reduction. It does not protect your ears.I now use a 28db noise reduction over the ear earmuff with the Anker headphones underneath.

Amazon had them on a deal and they lived up to the reviews in sound, fit and quality. Then unfortunately I misplaced them. Long story short I unknowingly dropped them getting out my car, found them crushed a month later nearby by either my car or the snow plow, the price to replace was too much, and the hunt was on for new earbud replacements. I tried a few lesser from soundcore but they weren't P3s and a few other brands but they didn't have the sound or fit I enjoyed with the Life P3s. If you want earbuds to stay in your ears while eating, bending down, exercising, or just sitting with clear sound and listening to music like it's playing live in front of you, Life P3s are the buds.

R1RXY2NUDI9XU9,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Battery Life is Amazing,Corey Helwig,4,"I’m going to compare these to the Apple AirPods Pro, because that’s what these are replacing for me.I enjoyed my AirPods. But the battery life started off not great, and over time, the earbuds developed some crackling. Finally decided to replace them and these earbuds are what I ordered.The last month or so I used the AirPods, I had to recharge the pack pretty much everyday. The earbuds would drain quickly, I’d put them back in the the charging case, and the entire charge would be gone within 24 hours.I received these exactly 1 month ago as I write this review. I use these earbuds the same amount I used my AirPods, and I’m only just now having to plug the case in to recharge it. It’s completely blown away all my expectations.The sound quality is also much better than the AirPods. The earpieces fit in more securely, and they are equally, if not slightly more comfortable than the AirPods were. I like a lot of bass with my music and these do not disappoint. All around real great quality product and way worth the money.My main criticism is that, compared to the AirPods, the transparency modes leave something to be desired. With the AirPods, I was able to have them in, and be able to hear people talking to me, if I needed to, with the music still playing. With these, I can hear someone’s voice if they’re talking to me, but I’d have to pause whatever I’m listening to in order to actually hear them. And even at that, the voices still sound muffled in all different transparency modes. So not a dealbreaker, but definitely a little bit of a pain in that regard.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023",AG6DAEYFKBXXPIPY743LLOZYNDCQ,1,14,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.1875,0.5096774193548388,Neutral

R3UCFTICRF5BY0,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic earbuds,A Maurer,5,"Our office rearranged the floor plan and I suddenly found myself sitting next to people who are on the phone all day long. I needed some noise canceling earbuds that would block the background noise without costing me $300. I’ve previously had first gen AirPods and my hustband has the Bose quiet comfort so I had something to compare these to. I also bought a pair of noise canceling jbl earbuds as well as the anker liberty 4 so I could try out multiple and pick which ones I like best.These were the winner for multiple reasons! First off, I genuinely like the look of these over all others I tried (Bose included). The oat white looks expensive and is discrete. Secondly, these fit my ears the best. I have small ears apparently, and the jbls and my husbands Bose quiet comfort were too large and fell out if I turned my head. I found that the anker liberty 4s were slightly more bulky which is part of the reason I ultimately chose these. Thirdly, you can’t beat the price of these. I got a lightning deal that made these only $50. And finally, noise cancellation and sound quality are great! The liberty 4s and Bose block more noise but this was the right amount for me and I like that there are different modes.Highly recommend these! Definitely would not purchase another pair of AirPods again after how great these are!","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AHYOBRQSTP3SP6JITEAFUXQF53UQ,1,0,Color: Oat White,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.17043010752688173,0.419815668202765,Neutral
R2Y5DU2M35KAFY,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't hurt and holds a charge forever,Failed frugalness,5,"I have gone through so many headphones and earbuds. Even my shokz that don't really go on or in your ears would end up hurting after a bit. I was beginning to think I'd never be able to have Bluetooth earbuds because the weight of them was too much or they fit in such a way as to almost instantly hurt. I've had these for almost a year now. After about 7 months they started falling out more so I got the silicone tips that have sort of 2 layers to them and they stay in well. The thing is, I can wear them all day doing the shopping so I don't have to listen to Mariah sing about Christmas or elevator music, and my ears don't hurt at all. These are the first ones I've ever had that I could say that. I also have only charged the case 4 times since I bought them, and only one of those times did it get below 2 dots out of 3 for the charge! The earbuds themselves have never batted an eye at a 2 hour or more outing either.Granted, the noise blocking isn't amazing but it is fine I think. My son is a musician and he says they are ok, but not amazing. I am not as picky as he is though and I think they sound pretty good. The microphone is a typical Bluetooth microphone. People can hear and understand me most of the time but occasionally it gets overloaded by nearby noise or something and I have to use the phone directly.Overall I think they were absolutely worth it. I don't like to give 5 star reviews because I distrust most of them. I can't really think of a reason to discount one star though unless it is because they don't have the same quality as earbuds that cost more than double what these are...but nobody expects them to!","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AGMX3WQBFSL2JBKSCJFGHC4PCUQQ,1,17,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.26607142857142857,0.4919642857142857,Positive
R3TB7QMD4XGCVK,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Works well, IF you can get them to fit!",RJM,4,"These buds sound okay, but that’s not why I bought the P3’s. My wife snores, and I needed some way to keep my marriage intact.Previously, I had a very old pair of Bose noise cancelling wired earbuds, but the battery died, and Bose is just too expensive. So I know what good noise cancelling is like, but I wanted something at a more reasonable price point.I was pleasantly surprised at the cancelling performance of the P3 earbuds, and the battery life in noise cancelling when you’re not playing music.Unfortunately, there is one problem.: the stock mushroom heads of the P3’s are utterly terrible. You need a good seal in your ear for the cancelling to work, and the design of the stock tips is poor. The various sizes don’t work for different reasons: either they are too small, or they deform in a way that doesn’t make a good seal. I think the engineers at Anker spent almost no time on the ergonomic design.Fortunately, though, I have many after market and leftover mushroom tips and I found one set that is… well, better. I still have to keep pushing the earbuds back into my ear holes because they work loose, but I can live with that.Not that anyone will listen, but a future version of these buds should go a little deeper into your ear, and perhaps the rubber could be slightly higher density. Just as a side note, you can buy longer mushroom tips that work okay, but then the earbuds won’t fit in the charger.

I haven’t tested the ANC bc I don’t really use the feature but I do need the noise isolation and its very good. I wish I never wasted the money I did on Apple AirPods. These are a much better value and have no bugs.The things that I don’t like about these:There is a delay when you use the touch sensitive controls, which is just the section of the earbud with the logo. It’s not the stem. You press the logo and there’s a half second delay before it takes effect. When you have to double press it makes you wonder if it worked or not. There is a setting in the app to make an audible chime when you press a button. I enabled that and it helps a little. I just wish it was a little faster.The lid on the case is a little flimsy and isn’t held by a magnet. It’s just a spring loaded hinge.The sound profile is bass heavy. Adjust the highs up in the EQ in the app and it fixed it.Overall I’m very happy with them! Oh and the battery life is good, at least without ANC on. I listened to them for at least 4-5 hours straight no problem and the battery gauge said it used about half.

I was looking for some “pretty darn awesome” sub-$100 ear buds and these are the ones I’ve minded on. My last pair finally died. I used them daily for the last 3 years and they have been beaten up, lost, found again, etc. I love the Anker products as my go-to for after market tech products without breaking the bank. The sound is much higher than the price point. They are somewhat customizable for sound and gestures to control them. They cancel noise pretty good but aren’t $400 Bose or other big name brand. I’d give the noise cancellation a 8.75 or 9 on a 1-10 scale.

R2ZJ6GUWDRCM2J,B093SLWMS7,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wow, just wow",Avalon,5,"Preface: I have the Sony XM4 buds right now. Not the XM3, the XM4, the brand new ones. They are the BEST sounding true wireless earbuds I have had thus far, and their battery life is no joke, I can’t kill it. Their current base price is $279.99. (I purchased them for that price)I got the Life P3 for school and just general listening because I didn’t want to risk losing or having my Sony’s stolen. When I paired and started listening to these earbuds, I couldn’t believe how good they sounded. I actually am starting to have some buyer’s remorse. I like the design of both the buds and the case, they’re quite sleek and compact. I selected the light blue color, since I don’t like how darker colors show oil from my skin. They fit great and create a good seal which is vital for the best potential bass response. The bass on these buds is no joke, and that’s coming from Soundcores Signature sound profile, meaning the standard equalizer setting, no customization. Bass is responsive without being too dirty or uncontrolled, mids (where vocals live) are present and clear, and highs are reproduced well without being too sharp. Of course they don’t have the same soundstage or clarity/sharpness as the Sony’s, but for less than a third of the price it’s almost laughable at how good these buds are by comparison. Let me give you some of my credentials. I’ve had the:-Sony XM3 & XM4 buds-AirPod Pro-Jabra Elite 75t-Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2-Master & Dynamics MW08All of these are some of the best if not the best these manufacturers offer. Music is incredibly important to me and my development as a human being, so I take my sound experience very seriously, doing thorough research and actual hardware/software testing. My three points for a great pair of buds for me is sound/battery/fit. I often listen to music in bed, so fit is important not just for bass. These buds stay in place no problem. The Life P3 companion app by Soundcore is also incredibly useful and modern in its aesthetics and overall design language. It puts the most important settings right in front without being flashy or gimmicky. A great overall experience both for the hardware and software.In short, if you want a great pair of wireless earbuds with great customizable sound, great fit with multiple eartip sizes included in box, good battery life with a case that has wireless charging, and a great app/software experience, look no further. YOU FOUND IT! A great accomplishment for Soundcore and one of the best audio values for consumers.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2021",AF662MI774VTXQP3NF5CBQGDF7XQ,1,0,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.2562560573754604,0.4868304580991148,Positive

Here's a detailed review covering various aspects:#### Design and Build Quality- **Design**: The AirPods maintain the iconic, minimalist design with a white finish. They are compact, lightweight, and fit comfortably in most ears.- **Build Quality**: They are made of high-quality plastic, which feels durable and premium. The magnetic case is sturdy and ensures the earbuds stay in place.#### Sound Quality- **Audio Performance**: The sound quality is clear and well-balanced, suitable for a wide range of music genres. The bass is adequate, though not as deep as some premium alternatives.- **Microphone**: The microphone quality is excellent for calls, thanks to beamforming technology that reduces background noise.#### Connectivity- **Bluetooth**: The 2nd Generation AirPods use Bluetooth 5.0, providing a stable and efficient connection. Pairing is seamless, especially with Apple devices due to the H1 chip.- **H1 Chip**: This chip allows for faster and more stable wireless connections, improved sound quality, and hands-free ""Hey Siri"" support.#### Battery Life- **Earbuds**: The earbuds offer up to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge.- **Charging Case**: The case provides multiple additional charges, extending the total battery life to more than 24 hours.- **Charging Options**: The case charges via a Lightning connector, and there is a wireless charging case available as an optional upgrade.#### Features- **Automatic Ear Detection**: The AirPods automatically pause playback when you remove them from your ears and resume when you put them back in.- **Touch Controls**: You can double-tap to play or skip forward.- **Hey Siri**: Voice-activated Siri support allows for hands-free control.#### Compatibility- **Apple Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches. Pairing is quick and easy, with automatic device switching.- **Android Devices**: The AirPods can be used with Android devices, though some features like automatic ear detection and Siri are not available.#### Pros and Cons**Pros:**- Seamless integration with Apple devices- Good sound quality- Long battery life with the charging case- Comfortable fit- Reliable connectivity with the H1 chip- Hands-free Siri support**Cons:**- Expensive compared to other wireless earbuds- Limited customization of touch controls- No active noise cancellation (ANC)- The white color can get dirty easily- Not ideal for audiophiles seeking superior sound quality#### ConclusionThe Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a solid choice for anyone deeply integrated into the Apple ecosystem, offering convenience, decent sound quality, and excellent connectivity. However, if you are looking for advanced features like noise cancellation or superior audio performance, you might want to consider other options or the AirPods Pro.Overall, they are a reliable and user-friendly option for everyday use, especially for those who prioritize convenience and seamless integration with their Apple devices.","Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2024",AEZU6KZWHPTL7JX3GXOFQHKM73UA,1,15,Set: Without AppleCare+,Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation),0.18549960967993756,0.461455893832943,Neutral

R2QGEC3WRQRMLX,B07PXGQC1Q,5.0 out of 5 stars Very practical,renee,5,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network.

These earbuds offer a lot of convenience and solid performance.Pros:Sound Quality: The audio quality is excellent, with clear highs and balanced mids. They’re great for listening to music, podcasts, and making phone calls.Seamless Connectivity: Pairing the AirPods with my iPhone and other Apple devices is incredibly smooth. The instant connection and switching between devices are standout features.Comfort and Fit: They fit comfortably in my ears and stay in place during workouts. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. I get several hours of continuous use, and the charging case provides multiple additional charges, making them perfect for long days and travel.Siri Integration: Hands-free Siri access is a handy feature, allowing me to control music, make calls, and get information without needing to touch my phone.Cons:Lack of Noise Cancellation: Unlike the Pro version, these AirPods don’t have active noise cancellation. While they do a decent job of passive noise isolation, it’s not enough in noisy environments.Price: They’re a bit on the expensive side, especially considering the lack of noise cancellation. There are other earbuds with similar or better features at a lower price point.Fit May Vary: While they fit my ears well, I’ve heard from friends that they don’t fit everyone perfectly. It’s worth trying them on before committing to a purchase.In summary, the Apple AirPods 2nd Generation offer great sound quality, convenience, and battery life, making them a solid choice for anyone in the Apple ecosystem. While they lack some advanced features like noise cancellation, they still provide a fantastic listening experience and seamless integration with Apple devices.","Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024",AH7LXZF3MXW5WLMCOOZJXPKU6NBQ,1,39,Set: Without AppleCare+,Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation),0.24956140350877196,0.48070175438596496,Positive

I use them to listen to my computer while I play music on my stereo in the background. I also don't feel them in my ear which is super nice. Over the ear headphones get too warm and uncomfortable, and in ear earbuds block out sound and get uncomfortable over extended use, so these are perfect. These also stay connected compared to my first ten AirPods which would constantly drop the connection. My only gripe is when I attempt to stream Spotify on my iPhone to my home stereo the AirPods will take over and connect if I am wearing them while using them for the computer, so I have to go back into Spotify on my phone and reconnect it to the stereo. Not the end of the world, but I wish there was a way to prevent that from happening.

R3TGOLM06TTGQ8,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars 100% honest review,James M.,4,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"".

R1HA6GWOISYTFN,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Purchased these in Nov 2019 & still going strong,Melanie Hawthorne,4,"I bought my 2nd gen Airpods back in 2019 and never expected for them to last this long. (In fact, I was a skeptic when Apple first announced how these things would stay in your ears.) Sounds quality hasn't diminished over time. It picks up ambient sound pretty well, sometimes making it hard for the caller to hear you. Sometimes it has a muted sound and the caller will say you sound muffled. So it's not perfect as a mic device but functions well enough most of the time that it's not a problem. Audio quality to me is great. Never have an issue with sound, music, or hearing a caller. They're not really noise-canceling, so if you're looking for that, you'll be disappointed. However, I've found that if I up the volume, it will drown out loud sounds. I don't like my volume extremely loud since I like to be able to hear what's going on around me, but for trains or large trucks rumbling by, the volume is excellent and still retains good quality. (Not that distortion sound that comes with playing music too loud.)Overall, I'd recommend. I've had this for nearly 5 years (bought it for myself as a Black Friday gift!), and I don't regret it. I see no need to upgrade to a Pro. Audiophiles may want surround sound type thing, in which I'd recommend a Pro, but 2nd gen works well enough for me (until prices drop for some of the newer ones).","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AGLIW2ME2UMV6MELUQXKQEP6CDLA,1,16,Set: Without AppleCare+,Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation),0.16880952380952383,0.4809523809523811,Neutral

R2RXIKIAXE4Z31,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Product,Misagp,4,"I tried many cheaper versions of bluetooth earbuds, but they are all touchy and annoyingly glitchy, compared to AirPods, which are just awesome! Pairs perfectly, just as most Apple products do. You can program them to do various things when you tap them, so you don't have to do everything through the phone. The voice recognition is very handy when driving and you need Siri to do something for you. The mic is a little quiet on phone calls, so I cup my hand to my mouth to direct sound to them when needed.After a while though, my left ear is sore from the shape of the earbud. It's probably just my ear shape. Still not interested in paying more for the smaller, more cushy ones. Hundreds of dollars is ridiculous.I recommend getting the little silicone case cover, as it helps you find the item, clip it to your phone, etc. Keep them clean, don't get them wet, don't store them in pockets and lose them. They seem to survive small drops. They do have a feature that makes noise to help you find them, but only if they still have some charge in their batteries.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AFZAUG5S6T5FHORGNTMQHNLQ6HZQ,1,1,Set: Without AppleCare+,Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation),0.22257575757575765,0.5924242424242425,Positive

Doesn't require Apple users to put in a password or set up an account or any of the other annoying things other wireless ear buds often require. I found them comfortable, similar in feel to my iPhone wired earbuds, and perhaps a little more secure in my ears. They work fine for me while running. Sound is good for an open earbud. My only wish is that there was a way to raise and lower volume manually... perhaps this comes in other Airpod versions. It may take more than one attempt to activate Siri, or start the audio, with the two taps.

But I ordered other Apple or different brands of ear buds, and absolutely none of them felt comfortable in my small ear canals. Even the ones with multiple rubber things small enough to supposedly fit. All of the styles I had to return got far greater reviews for sound quality, and they all allow you to see the amount of battery charge left on the case.These earbuds have so-so sound quality, and I never use them for phone calls. So I can’t speak about that aspect. The choices of what you can tap on either the left or right side for are limited. Other ear phones or buds have multiple ways you can touch your right and left sides, to get sound levels, on/off, next track, answering phone, etc. The main thing these do is allow you to use Siri, as they are an Apple product, albeit several models “old.” The main drawback to these is that you cannot look at the case to see how much battery charge is left. You must open the case up when your Bluetooth area is open within your phone’s or iPads’ setting, in order for that to tell you the battery percentage for both the ear buds and the case which can charge them. That is kind of a pain. They do hold battery percentage fairly well, I can say.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2024",AE7T57CQOLJAYEZIWYZFIY4JO5EQ,1,4,Set: Without AppleCare+,Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation),0.13480392156862744,0.3744397759103642,Neutral

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2284,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.16530880230880232,0.5307694003527337,Neutral
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,563,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.17547510822510823,0.5111769480519481,Neutral

After i did that the audio was great, nice and loud. The buds fit nice for me with the small ear tips, not uncomfortable. The case is pretty light as well which i personally like a lot. Pretty solid headphones, I quite like them.

R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.15609410430839002,0.45681311413454295,Neutral

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,70,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds – True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,0.12759740259740257,0.448728354978355,Neutral

The music sound quality is among the worst I've heard (sound engineer) and cannot be mitigated by software. I.e. running the media through a processor such as Poweramp equalizer will only distort the sound. These drivers are simply not made for accurate sound reproduction from media. Voices: absolutely. Call quality is excellent. But that is it. Concerned about construction as they are remarkably light. The case is an exercise in patience as there are both metal and plasyic prongs that must line up. Force it and the buds will be rendered useless an irreparable. Clearly, no expense was spared to install good drivers (speakers) or a solid structure nor a painless way to dock to buds.None at all.Probably leftovers from a Chinese manufacturer that changes its ridiculous nonsensical names bianually.Battery life is excellent.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2023",AFKDX52SQCTTCH445OZ6QUX7F3JQ,1,2,Color: White,Panasonic True Wireless Earbuds (RZ-S300W Series),0.18749999999999997,0.5736904761904761,Neutral
R2RSE6UHEK6L69,B0863H1JKB,1.0 out of 5 stars First ever disappointment with Panasonic,M. Hoffman,1,"I am 73 years of age and have been purchasing Panasonic products since I was in college. Transistor radios, boom boxes, Technics components, telephones, plasma tv (still working more than 10 years old), etc, etc. Most recently I purchased two pairs of Wings bluetooth earbuds. They worked well, BUT their life seemed relatively short. I am still attempting to determine what a reasonable life is for bluetooth earbuds. Now, I purchased these ""true wireless"" (?) earbuds twice. The first pair did not charge. The second pair which I kept has many, many problems with the sensors, maintaining bluetooth connection, etc. When they work, they work well, but it was a full two weeks until the full volume kicked in and that occurred unexpectedly after multiple beeping, changes of volume, cutout, noise setting, etc, etc. Last night was the first time they worked relatively flawlessly until I arrived back home after a two hour walk. They began cutting out again. Considering that I could have bought innumerable cheaper bluetooth earbuds of other manufacturers and far less expensive, it is disappointing. I sincerely hope this is not a continuing problem with Panasonic products. Their customer service is also difficult. As an example, although the directions say you should use ONLY the power cord supplied for charging, the customer service said I could use any generic USB C cord. He had no explanation for the directions. They also fall out of your ears. I am at the end of my rope with these things. Going back. I reset them with the app, explored all attempts to remedy the problems, but they are just too frustrating.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2021",AFBMBLTASTCHRQT6H2FUSQGWBM3A,1,9,Color: White,Panasonic True Wireless Earbuds (RZ-S300W Series),0.08575268817204301,0.4830645161290322,Neutral

Ambient sound was ok. The battery life was slightly shorter than advertised. So the return window closed on October 9th, which was 30 days after purchase. On today October 22, I walked in the house, kissed my wife and the left bud falls out of my ear. The bud breaks open and is now useless. Don’t think I’ll purchase these again.
